In 1987 , J. K. Rigby and colleagues suggested that pachycephalosaur domes were heat-exchange organs used for thermoregulation , based on their internal " radiating structures " ( trabeculae ) . This idea was supported by a few other writers in the mid-1990s . In 1998 , Goodwin and colleagues considered the lack of sinuses in the skull of " Stegoceras " and the " honeycomb " -like network of vascular bone in the dome ill-suited for head-butting , and pointed out that the bones adjacent to the dome risked fracture during such contact . Building on the idea that the ossified tendons that stiffened the tails of " Stegoceras " and other pachycephalosaurs enabled them to take a tripodal stance ( first suggested by Maryańska and Osmólska in 1974 ) , Goodwin et al. suggested these structures could have protected the tail against flank-butting , or that the tail itself could have been used as a weapon . In 2004 , Goodwin and colleagues studied the cranial histology of pachycephalosaurs , and found that the vascularity ( including the trabeculae ) of the domes decreased with age , which they found inconsistent with a function in either head-butting or heat-exchange . They also suggested that a dense layer of Sharpey 's fibers near the surface of the dome indicated that it had an external covering in life , which makes it impossible to know the shape of the dome in a living animal . These researchers instead concluded that the domes were mainly for species recognition and communication ( as in some African bovids ) and that use in sexual display was only secondary . They further speculated that the external covering of the domes was brightly coloured in life , or may have changed colour seasonally .

Cyanotrama is a fungal genus in the Hymenochaetales order . The genus is monotypic , containing the single species Cyanotrama rimosa , widely distributed in western North America . It has also been collected in single occasions in Ethiopia and Iran . The fungus causes a white rot in conifers , especially junipers . " C. rimosa " was originally named " Poria rimos " in 1920 by William Alphonso Murrill , and later known as " Diplomitoporus rimosus . " Molecular work revealed that the species was aligned not with the polyporoid fungi as previously assumed , but rather with the hymenochaetoid fungi , and " Cyanotrama " was created to contain it . The genus name refers to the strong cyanophilic reaction ( stainable with blue dyes ) of the skeletal hyphae , particularly noticeable in the trama .

Though the Dreamcast launch had been successful , Sony still held 60 percent of the overall video game market share in North America with the PlayStation at the end of 1999 . On March 2 , 1999 , in what one report called a " highly publicized , vaporware-like announcement " Sony revealed the first details of its " next generation PlayStation , " which Ken Kutaragi claimed would allow video games to convey unprecedented emotions . The center of Sony 's marketing plan and the upcoming PlayStation 2 itself was a new CPU ( clocked at 294 MHz ) jointly developed by Sony and Toshiba - the " Emotion Engine " - which Kutaragi announced would feature a graphics processor with 1,000 times more bandwidth than contemporary PC graphics processors and a floating-point calculation performance of 6.2 gigaflops , rivaling most supercomputers . Sony , which invested $ 1.2 billion in two large-scale integration semiconductor fabrication plants to manufacture the PlayStation 2 's " Emotion Engine " and " Graphics Synthesizer , " designed the machine to push more raw polygons than any video game console in history . Sony claimed the PlayStation 2 could render 75 million raw polygons per second with absolutely no effects , and 38 million without accounting for features such as textures , artificial intelligence , or physics . With such effects , Sony estimated the PlayStation 2 could render 7.5 million to 16 million polygons per second , whereas independent estimates ranged from 3 million to 20 million , compared to Sega 's estimates of more than 3 million to 6 million for the Dreamcast . The system would also utilize the DVD-ROM format , which could hold substantially more data than the Dreamcast 's GD-ROM format . Because it could connect to the Internet while playing movies , music , and video games , Sony hyped PlayStation 2 as the future of home entertainment .

Đurađ Branković :
" The Savior God of Second Isaiah [ and his Suffering Servant ] would have been gibberish to David ... The Biblical revelation - if I may use the word - is a revelation of human potentialities which are first seen as worthy of God , and then as demanded by the reality of God . These potentialities are then demanded by God of human beings , and ultimately made possible by God ; this is one of the meanings of grace . I simply do not believe in the Great Warrior God who exterminated the Canaanites . Some who share my faith do . They also profess belief in Jesus Christ the Son of God who said that he who would save his life must lose it , and who implied that a good way to lose it quickly is to love those who hate you and pray for those who persecute you . How does one speak of a god who exhibits both these features [ Great Warrior and love of enemies ] ? I am compelled to say simply that he does not exist , and that those who profess this monstrous faith worship an idol . That they are sincere touches me lightly : so I suppose were most of the worshippers of Baal and Anath , and most witch-burners .

After a winter and spring full of court action , the Pilots reported for spring training under new manager Dave Bristol , unsure of where they would play . The owners had given tentative approval to the Milwaukee group , but the state of Washington got an injunction on March 16 to stop the deal . PNSI immediately filed for bankruptcy - a move intended to forestall post-sale legal action . At the bankruptcy hearing a week later , Milkes testified there was not enough money to pay the coaches , players , and office staff . Had Milkes been more than 10 days late in paying the players , they would have all become free agents and left Seattle without a team for the season . With this in mind , Federal Bankruptcy Referee Sidney Volinn declared the Pilots bankrupt on April 1 - six days before Opening Day - clearing the way for them to move to Milwaukee . The team 's equipment had been sitting in Provo , Utah , with the drivers awaiting word on whether to drive toward Seattle or Milwaukee . The move came so late that Selig had to scrap his initial plans to change the team 's colors to navy and red in honor of the minor-league Brewers of his youth . Instead , the Brewers were stuck using old Pilots ' uniforms , with the team name replaced . One legacy of the Brewers ' roots in Seattle is that their colors are still blue and gold , although the shades have been darker since 2000 .

If a batted ball ( other than a foul tip , with less than 2 strikes ) is caught in flight , the batter is out - called a fly out - and all runners must tag up . A batted ball cannot be ruled foul or fair while in flight ; a batted ball that is past first or third base will be called foul or fair based on where it ceases to be in flight , or where it is first touched by a fielder , whichever occurs first . A fly out on a ball in foul territory is also called a foul out . A foul tip , which by definition is always caught in flight , is a strike by special rule , and not an out , unless caught as a 3rd strike .

In 1916 the conservative coalition that acted as the Heavenly Twins power base had yet to form . Modern historians do not endorse Spengler 's view , but they have questioned whether the twin 's influence at Versailles was really decisive . Were they really formidable enough that the archetypal " man of power " Lloyd George , with his " lightning ingenuity " and uncanny psychological insight , would really have been helpless before them ? Antony Lentin thinks not , suggesting that Lloyd George had secretly wanted high reparations to be imposed and had set the Twins up as scapegoats .

Nonlinear control theory covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle . It applies to more real-world systems , because all real control systems are nonlinear . These systems are often governed by nonlinear differential equations . The mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more rigorous and much less general , often applying only to narrow categories of systems . These include limit cycle theory , Poincaré maps , Lyapunov stability theory , and describing functions . If only solutions near a stable point are of interest , nonlinear systems can often be linearized by approximating them by a linear system obtained by expanding the nonlinear solution in a series , and then linear techniques can be used . Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using numerical methods on computers , for example by simulating their operation using a simulation language . Even if the plant is linear , a nonlinear controller can often have attractive features such as simpler implementation , faster speed , more accuracy , or reduced control energy , which justify the more difficult design procedure .

Cannon gave his account of the run in his 2015 biography : " After I caught the ball , the first person looking me in the eye was Larry Grantham . I knew how good he was . I wanted to go to the left toward the open field , but there he was , so I cut back to the right , and he missed the tackle . I started down field , following the sideline , picking up a few blocks , and some guys missed their tackles . Finally , I broke into the open , and there was nobody left but me and Jake Gibbs . Gibbs thought I was going to the wide side of the field , so I gave him a little head fake . Now I 've got to give Jake credit on this : That was the only tackle he had missed in his entire career to that point . Of course , with the team he had around him , that was the only tackle he tried to make in four years . After I had the clear sailing to the goal line , it was a question of was I going to make it , was the referee going to beat me there , or was the cameraman gaining on both of us going to outrun the whole bunch .

During 16th and 17th century many fundamental economic changes occurred , these resulted in rising incomes and paved the way to the industrialisation . After 1600 , the North Sea region took over the role of the leading economic centre of Europe from the Mediterranean , which prior to this date , particularly in northern Italy , had been the most highly developed part of Europe . Great Britain , together with the Low Countries , profited more in the long run from the expansion of trade in the Atlantic and Asia than the pioneers of this trade , Spain and Portugal , fundamentally because of the success of the mainly privately owned enterprises in these two Northern countries in contrast to the arguably less successful state-owned economic systems in Iberia .

In bringing together the various statements issued under bin Laden 's name since 1994 , this volume forms part of a growing discourse that seeks to demythologize the terrorist network . Newly translated from the Arabic , annotated with a critical introduction by Islamic scholar Bruce Lawrence , this collection places the statements in their religious , historical and political context . It shows how bin Laden 's views draw on and differ from other strands of radical Islamic thought ; it also demonstrates how his arguments vary in degrees of consistency , and how his evasions concerning the true nature and extent of his own group , and over his own role in terrorist attacks , have contributed to the perpetuation of his personal mythology .

A combination of factors is also possible .

Indeed , it was around this time that the ancient counties which made up modern Cumbria came into existence . Westmorland , in 1177 , was formally created from the baronies of Appleby and Kendal . The barony of Copeland was added to the Carlisle area to form the county of Cumberland in 1177 . Lancashire was one of the last counties to be formed in England in 1182 , although its boundaries may have been fixed around 1100 . Why the Furness and Cartmel peninsulas were included in the county of Lancashire when they are entirely cut off from the main body by Morecambe Bay is not immediately obvious . If the borders were settled as early as 1100 the decision may have been due to the influence of Roger de Poitou who held lands on both sides of the Bay , but it is more likely that it was a result of the cross-sands communications between Furness and Lancaster being stronger than those with Cumberland and Westmorland to the north due to the difficulties of travelling out of the area .

However , s 4 of the Statute only affected UK laws that were to apply as part of Australian Commonwealth law , not UK laws that were to apply as part of the law of any Australian State . Thus , the Parliament of the United Kingdom still had the power to legislate for the states and territories . In practice , however , this power was almost never exercised . For example , in a referendum on secession in Western Australia in April 1933 , 68 % of voters favoured seceding from Australia and becoming a separate Dominion . The state government sent a delegation to Westminster to request that this result be enacted into law , but the British government refused to intervene on the grounds that this was a matter for the Australian government .

Once an agency produces these strategies , it can feed them into the simulation to test how smugglers may adapt their methods in response . Information regarding The Modeling Complex Adaptive Behavior Project can be found in The MITRE Digest .

Historically , StatArb evolved out of the simpler pairs trade strategy , in which stocks are put into pairs by fundamental or market-based similarities . When one stock in a pair outperforms the other , the under performing stock is bought long and the outperforming stock is sold short with the expectation that under performing stock will climb towards its outperforming partner . Mathematically speaking , the strategy is to find a pair of stocks with high correlation , cointegration , or other common factor characteristics . Various statistical tools have been used in the context of pairs trading ranging from simple distance-based approaches to more complex tools such as cointegration and copula concepts .

The argument principle can be used to efficiently locate zeros or poles of meromorphic functions on a computer . Even with rounding errors , the expression formula _ 10 will yield results close to an integer ; by determining these integers for different contours " C " one can obtain information about the location of the zeros and poles . Numerical tests of the Riemann hypothesis use this technique to get an upper bound for the number of zeros of Riemann 's formula _ 11 function inside a rectangle intersecting the critical line .

First Mate Owen Chase returned to Nantucket on June 11 , 1821 , to find he had a 14-month-old daughter he had never seen . Four months later he had completed an account of the disaster , the " Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex " ; Herman Melville used it as one of the inspirations for his novel " Moby-Dick " ( 1851 ) . In December , Chase sailed as first mate on the whaler " Florida , " and then as captain of " Winslow " for each subsequent voyage , until he could afford to build his own whaler , " Charles Carrol . " Chase remained at sea for 19 years , only returning home for short periods every two or three years , each time fathering a child . His first two wives died while he was at sea . He divorced his third wife when he found she had given birth 16 months after he had last seen her , although he subsequently brought up the child as his own . In September 1840 , two months after the divorce was finalized , he married for the fourth and final time and retired from whaling . Memories of the harrowing ordeal on the " Essex " haunted Chase , and he suffered terrible headaches and nightmares . Later in his life , he began hiding food in the attic of his Nantucket house on Orange Street and was eventually institutionalized . He died in Nantucket on March 7 , 1869 , aged 73 .

Lorentzian traversable wormholes would allow travel in both directions from one part of the universe to another part of that same universe very quickly or would allow travel from one universe to another . The possibility of traversable wormholes in general relativity was first demonstrated in a 1973 paper by Homer Ellis and independently in a 1973 paper by K. A. Bronnikov . Ellis analyzed the topology and the geodesics of the Ellis drainhole , showing it to be geodesically complete , horizonless , singularity-free , and fully traversable in both directions . The drainhole is a solution manifold of Einstein 's field equations for a vacuum space-time , modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor with antiorthodox polarity ( negative instead of positive ) . ( Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as ' exotic ' because of the antiorthodox coupling , finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive . ) The solution depends on two parameters : , which fixes the strength of its gravitational field , and , which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections . When is set equal to 0 , the drainhole 's gravitational field vanishes . What is left is the Ellis wormhole , a nongravitating , purely geometric , traversable wormhole .
In the 1920s , jute prices rose dramatically which also lead to increased production . Jute prices fell in the 1930s despite the Indian Jute Mills Association trying to stop the price decline by reducing working hours . The British Raj formed the Bengal Jute Inquiry Committee to create reports on the state of the Jute industry in Bengal in the 1930s during the Great Depression . It published two reports , one in 1934 and another in 1939 . The report identified that low prices in one year led to lower production and higher prices the next year , this was followed subsequently by higher production and lower prices next year . The reports recommended the government restrict the production of jute .

Another response , the " Adventures of the Brown Girl ( companion to the Black girl of Mr. Bernard Shaw ) in her Search for God " by Mr and Mrs I. I. Kazi was published in 1933 by A. H. Stockwell . This was a liberal Muslim reply which argued that the monotheistic view of the divine existed throughout history , and thus that " every prophet preached Islam in its theistic aspects . " Other titles include W. R. Matthews ' " The Adventures of Gabriel in his Search for Mr. Shaw " ( 1933 ) and " The Adventures of the White Girl in her Search for Knowledge " ( 1934 ) by Marcus Hayman . In Matthews ' book God sends the Archangel Gabriel to seek out the real Shaw , discovering four " sham " Shaws ( his public personas ) that hide the real individual . Hayman 's book was a left-wing criticism of Shaw 's religious ideology . In 1973 Brigid Brophy published " The Adventures of God in his Search for the Black Girl , " in which Shaw himself appears .

The temperature inside the leach dump often rises spontaneously as a result of microbial activities . Thus , thermophilic iron-oxidizing chemolithotrophs such as thermophilic " Acidithiobacillus " species and " Leptospirillum " and at even higher temperatures the thermoacidophilic archaeon " Sulfolobus ( Metallosphaera sedula ) " may become important in the leaching process above 40 ° C. Similarly to copper , " Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans " can oxidize U to U with O as electron acceptor . However , it is likely that the uranium leaching process depends more on the chemical oxidation of uranium by Fe , with " At. ferrooxidans " contributing mainly through the reoxidation of Fe to Fe as described above .

Le Sueur came to Canada with the Jesuits to their mission at Sault Sainte Marie , but very soon he turned himself to fur trade and became a coureur des bois . He was fluent in several Native languages , which was crucial to his success in trade . Around 1683 , he received some samples of bluish clay from the middle reaches of a tributary of the Mississippi and took it back to France to be analyzed . A chemist , Alexandre L 'Huillier , deemed it to be copper ore .

As the ideal lens system , the contrast reaches zero at the spatial frequency of 500 cycles per millimeter . However , at lower spatial frequencies the contrast is considerably lower than that of the perfect system in the previous example . In fact , the contrast becomes zero on several occasions even for spatial frequencies lower than 500 cycles per millimeter . This explains the gray circular bands in the spoke image shown in the above figure . In between the gray bands , the spokes appear to invert from black to white and " vice versa , " this is referred to as contrast inversion , directly related to the sign reversal in the real part of the optical transfer function , and represents itself as a shift by half a period for some periodic patterns .

The Regiment 's 1st and 2d Battalions were attacked by an overwhelming force estimated between 3,000 and 5,000 Japanese soldiers . It was one of the largest attacks attempted in the Pacific Theater during World War II . Although both units fought furiously , the enemy soon penetrated the Battalions ' combined perimeter and inflicted overwhelming casualties . In the first minutes of the attack , approximately 30 wounded soldiers walked , crawled , or were carried into Captain Salomon 's aid station , and the small tent soon filled with wounded men . As the perimeter began to be overrun , it became increasingly difficult for Captain Salomon to work on the wounded . He then saw a Japanese soldier bayoneting one of the wounded soldiers lying near the tent . Firing from a squatting position , Captain Salomon quickly killed the enemy soldier . Then , as he turned his attention back to the wounded , two more Japanese soldiers appeared in the front entrance of the tent . As these enemy soldiers were killed , four more crawled under the tent walls . Rushing them , Captain Salomon kicked the knife out of the hand of one , shot another , and bayoneted a third . Captain Salomon butted the fourth enemy soldier in the stomach and a wounded comrade then shot and killed the enemy soldier . Realizing the gravity of the situation , Captain Salomon ordered the wounded to make their way as best they could back to the regimental aid station , while he attempted to hold off the enemy until they were clear . Captain Salomon then grabbed a rifle from one of the wounded and rushed out of the tent . After four men were killed while manning a machine gun , Captain Salomon took control of it . When his body was later found , 98 dead enemy soldiers were piled in front of his position . Captain Salomon 's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself , his unit , and the United States Army .

The special feature of this organ 's design is that it is extremely compact for its disposition and at the same time , as a result of a pipe construction specially developed by Oberlinger it can be moved about away from the wall . This compact structure was necessary so that view of the sumptuous high altar from the nave wouldn 't be obscured by the organ . A special construction of the air intake was required to achieve this small size . The design was accomplished by organ master and architect Wolfgang Oberlinger in close partnership with the diocese 's architects and conservators .

Consider a fluid of electrons in a background of heavy , positively charged ions . For simplicity , we ignore the motion and spatial distribution of the ions , approximating them as a uniform background charge . This simplification is permissible since the electrons are lighter and more mobile than the ions , provided we consider distances much larger than the ionic separation . In condensed matter physics , this model is referred to as jellium .
In the debate , Derrida praised Austin 's work , but argued that Austin is wrong to banish what Austin calls " infelicities " from the " normal " operation of language . One " infelicity , " for instance , occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is " sincere " or " merely citational " ( and therefore possibly ironic ) . Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily " citational , " due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing , and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings . Derrida takes Searle to task for attempting to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker 's inaccessible " intention . " Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies , once it becomes hearable or readable . All speech acts borrow from a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context , and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible . This significance , Derrida argues , cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention .

Arizona " [ that ] leaves that decision to stand as an arbitrary disclosure requirement , rather than the protection against coercive interrogation that it was originally crafted to be . " The author noted the purpose of " Miranda " was to address psychologically pressured interviews and that it had noted that adequate protection was essential in order " to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings . " The " Miranda " decision was intended to prevent coercion not merely to require a " disclosure of legal facts . " The present decision " allow [ ed ] a waiver of the right to occur after interrogation had commenced , through a response to that interrogation . " As a result , two subtly different meanings of " right to remain silent " could be construed , and a suspect who was ( in the words of " Miranda v. Arizona " ) " vulnerable , unassertive , and in need of protection " - precisely the kind of suspect " Miranda " aimed at protecting - would be left unaware :

Pohlmann struck camp and deployed his infantry battalions in a line facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front . The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar 's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear . The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position . Pohlmann 's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford into the mouth of his cannon , and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind . Wellesley 's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby , but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide . While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages , Peepulgaon and Waroor , one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left . On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages , Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer , Captain John Johnson , who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot . Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann 's left flank .

In electromagnetic designs , the trigger , instead of being mechanically linked to the action of the marker , simply activates an electronic micro-switch ( or more recently , a magnetic or optical sensor ) . That information is passed through control circuitry to a computer-controlled solenoid valve which can open and close very quickly and precisely , allowing gas to move into or out of various pressure chambers in the marker to move the bolt and fire the paintball . This disconnect of the trigger from the action allows electronic trigger pulls to be very short in length and very lightweight ( similar to a mouse click ; the mechanisms are virtually identical ) , which dramatically increases rate-of-fire over a fully mechanical design . Solenoid-controlled gas valve designs also allow for reduced weight of internal parts , which both lightens overall weight and reduces the time it takes for the marker to cycle through firing a single paintball .

In 1915 the British began talks with the indigenous people of the land that would become Enugu about its acquisition in order to lay the Eastern Line railway and to build a colliery . The first houses built in the area were in a temporary settlement consisting of Igbo traditional mud housing inhabited by a W.J. Leck and some other Europeans on Hill-top , the only plain on the escarpment rolling before the jungled Milliken Hill . Antiques of the old residence of the colonialists called the " Europeans quarters " still abound on the Hill-top , an outskirt of Enugwu-Ngwo town . Another settlement known as " Ugwu Alfred " ( Igbo : Alfred 's Hill ) or " Alfred 's Camp , " inhabited by an Alfred Inoma ( a leader of indigenous labourers from Onitsha ) and his labourers , was located on a hillside . After the land acquisition by the British , Frederick Lugard , the Governor-General of Nigeria at the time , named the colliery built at the bottom of the Udi Hills " Enugu Coal Camp " to distinguish it from Enugwu Ngwo which overlooks the city from atop a scarp on Enugu 's west . The first coal mine in the Enugu area was the Udi mine opened in 1915 which was shut down two years later and replaced with the Iva Valley mine . Enugu became a major coal mining area and the only significant one in West Africa . The Eastern Line railway connecting Enugu with Port Harcourt was completed in 1916 in order to export the coal through its seaport of which the city was created for this purpose . Enugu became one of the few cities in West Africa created out of contact with Europeans . By 1916 parts of Enugu reserved for Europeans were set up by the colonial government . The area now known as the Government Reserved Area ( GRA ) became the European Quarters located north of the Ogbete River ; alongside this was a section developed for African residents located south of the river . The built-up area of Enugu comprised these two areas , and by 1917 the city officially gained township status . On the African side of the city a rapid influx of migrant workers sparked the development of squatter camps on the Udi Hills near the coal mines and the Iva Valley .

In order to contract Roberts syndrome , a child must inherit the defective gene in an autosomal recessive manner . In other words , the child must inherit two copies of the defective gene ( one from each parent ) . The ESCO2 gene has a specific effect on cell division in Roberts syndrome patients . In normal cell division , each chromosome is copied and then attached to its newly formed copy at the centromere ( the center portion of a chromosome ) . However , in Roberts syndrome cell division , the copies are frequently not attached at the centromere . As a result , the chromosomes do not get lined up properly , which causes the cell to divide very slowly or even to not divide at all . The new cells typically will have too many or too few chromosomes . The odd number of chromosomes causes the defective cells to die , which leads to the malformations associated with Roberts syndrome .

The philosophy of Recognition , as outlined by thinkers like Utpaladeva , teaches that though the identity of all souls is one with God ( Isvara ) or Shiva ( which is the single reality , Being and absolute consciousness ) , they have forgotten this due to Maya or ignorance . However , through knowledge one can recognize one 's authentic divine nature and become a liberated being . Another important element of Trika theology is the active and dynamic nature of consciousness , which is described as the spontaneous vibration or pulsation ( " spanda " ) of universal consciousness , which is an expression of its freedom ( " svātāntrya " ) and power ( " Śakti " ) . Because of this , though this philosophy is idealist , it affirms the reality of the world and everyday life , as a real transformation ( " parinama " ) , manifestation or appearance ( " ābhāsa " ) of the absolute consciousness . The Absolute is also explained through the metaphor of light ( " prakasha " ) and reflective awareness ( " vimarsha " ) .

The history of liaison psychiatry is partly a history of psychiatry and medicine . Galen was highly influential for over 1500 years in medicine particularly advocating the use of experimentation to advance knowledge . The polymath physician Avicenna produced many insights into medicine but only became influential in Western medicine when William Harvey 's elucidation of the circulatory system forced a re-evaluation of Galen 's work . The French philosopher René Descartes began the dualistic debate on the division between mind and body . Johann Christian August Heinroth is credited with the origination of the term psychosomatic illness . At the beginning of the 19th century Johann Christian Reil created the term psychiatry whilst the polymath Benjamin Rush wrote " Diseases of the Mind . " The philosopher Spinoza 's concept of conatus , Mesmer 's development of hypnosis together with Charcot 's refinement of this technique influenced Sigmund Freud whose development of psychoanalytic theory was to have a profound impact on the development of liaison psychiatry . Under the guidance of Alan Gregg , psychoanalysis impacted on hospital medicine through figures such as Franz Alexander , Stanley Cobb and Felix Deutsch .

But if the moths themselves were not like the wasps one might argue that it was accidental that the habits were so alike , but the general appearance and structure are in conjunction with the habits so alike that in the species of " Pseudosphex " it is impossible to distinguish moth from wasp on the flower-heads of " Ageratum conyzoides " unless one is within eighteen inches or so , while on the wing at any distance it is quite impossible to distinguish them ... the species of " Pseudosphex " are mimics of the highest degree .

Bioluminescence is common among marine animals , so counterillumination may be widespread , though light has other functions , including attracting prey and signalling .

Because of its waterlogged condition the Flag Fen Basin was an area where peat deposits developed around 2000 BCE , and they survive there today . Archaeologists believe that the community was destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age by a fire that damaged the posts that held the homes above the waterlogged earth , causing the dwellings to collapse into the river and forcing the inhabitants to flee . The effects of the fire then carbonized the remains of the collapsed buildings , helping to preserve them .

A sample of 1,000 independent bits is enough to ensure an absolute error of at most 0.081 on the estimation of the parameter " p " of the underlying Bernoulli variable with a confidence of at least 0.99 . The same size cannot guarantee a threshold less than 0.088 with the same confidence 0.99 when the error is identified with the probability that a 20-year-old man living in New York does not fit the ranges of height , weight and waistline observed on 1,000 Big Apple inhabitants . The accuracy shortage occurs because both the VC dimension and the detail of the class of parallelepipeds , among which the one observed from the 1,000 inhabitants ' ranges falls , are equal to 6 .

The vowel phonemes of this language are basic . They use / a , e , i , o , u / . The vowel length is similar to the consonant lengths . Linguists do not interpret long vowels in writing so they use shortcuts like macrons ( a line over the vowel indicating a longer length ) , but in Tikopia writing they use two identical juxtaposed vowels . According to the Tikopia dictionary , " This has typographical simplicity , but may present a problem of interpretation as to where long vowel and rearticulation actually occur .

In public safety and law enforcement , gunshot location systems are often used in high-crime areas for rapid alerts and awareness into the communications and dispatch center where the alerts are used to direct first responders to the scene of the gunfire , thus increasing arrest rates , improving officer safety , securing witnesses and evidence , and enhancing investigations , as well as in the long run deterring gun crimes , shootings and especially " celebratory gunfire " ( the practice of shooting weapons in the air for fun ) . Gunshot location systems based upon wide-area acoustic surveillance coupled with persistent incident data storage transcends dispatch-only uses because reporting of urban gunfire ( via calls to 9-1-1 ) can be as low as 25 % , which means that law enforcement agencies and their crime analysts have incomplete data regarding true activity levels and patterns . With a wide-area acoustic-surveillance-based approach combined with a persistent repository of gunfire activity ( i.e. , a database ) , agencies have closer to 100 % activity data that can be analyzed for patterns and trends to drive directed patrols and intelligence-led policing . Additional benefits include aiding investigators to find more forensic evidence to solve crimes and provide to prosecutors to strengthen court cases resulting in a higher conviction rate . With the accuracy of a gunshot location system and the ability to geo-reference to a specific street address , versus a dearth of information that typically is the case when citizens report gunfire incidents to 9-1-1 , agencies can also infer shooters by comparing with known criminal locations , including those on parole and probation ; investigators can also at times infer intended victims and hence predict and prevent reprisals .
The concept and practice of Natural Farming was pioneered by Masanobu Fukuoka of Japan , who visited Save at his Kalpavruksh farm in 1997 as a special guest to commemorate India 's 50 years of independence led by Mahatma Gandhi . While both men depended on tree crops for the sustainability of their farms , Save organized his own vision of natural farming far more aggressively around the active irrigation of his tree crops , supplemented by grains , vegetables , and livestock , as did Fukuoka . Save is credited with pioneering the " platform and trench " system to provide water to his tree crops storing moisture in the soil year round . In the beginning , in order to sustain his farm until the long-life fruit trees matured and yielded value , he integrated short , medium and long-life plant species into his early scheme to rapidly establish complete ground cover and optimize yield . Briefly , Save 's polyculture plant categories and natural farming philosophy are based on this pattern :

Functional characterization has only been performed for FlaI , a Type II / IV secretion system ATPase super-family member and PibD / FlaK . FlaI forms a hexamer which hydrolyses ATP and most likely generates energy to assemble the archaellum . PibD cleaves the N-terminus of the archaellins before they can be assembled . FlaH ( ) has a RecA-like fold and inactive ATPase domains . FlaH and FlaJ are the two other core components that together with FlaI to form a core platform / motor . FlaX acts as a scaffold around the motor in Crenarchaeota . The exact role of accessory proteins FlaF and FlaG is poorly understood . The genes coding for the signaling components such as flaC , flaD , flaE are only present in Euryarchaeota and interact with Chemotaxis proteins ( e.g. , CheY , CheD and CheC2 ) to sense environmental signals ( such as exposure to light of specific wavelength , nutrient conditions etc . ) .

F. Northal 's " English Folk Rhymes " ( 1892 ) , all included collected singing games . However , the first studies to focus solely on this area were William Wells Newell 's " Games and Songs of American Children " ( 1883 ) and Alice Gomme 's " The Traditional Games of England , Scotland , and Ireland " ( 1894-8 ) , both considered landmark works in the serious study of the subject on respective sides of the Atlantic .

Some of these problems were rectified by work like that of Norman Douglas , who produced " London Street Games " in 1916 , focusing on the urban working classes .

The student protests and the occupation of university buildings injected new life into a persistent anti-government movement that was into its 140th day on 1 November . Three of the initiators of the student occupation had held a meeting with Mihail Mikov a few days prior to its beginning , during which the then chairman of the National Parliament is believed to have been dismissive of and expressed a lack of understanding of the demonstrations .

Police arrived at the place , but left shortly thereafter . The video of the clash could be seen at the following link : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = gFNhc-WSohQ By the next day , several universities across the country were occupied by students , including NBU , NATFIZ , VTU and UNWE .

The fact that the Alans invaded Parthia through Hyrcania shows that at the time many Alans were still based north-east of the Caspian Sea . By the early 2nd century AD the Alans were in firm control of the Lower Volga and Kuban . These lands had earlier been occupied by the Aorsi and the Siraces , whom the Alans apparently absorbed , dispersed and / or destroyed , since they were no longer mentioned in contemporaneous accounts . It is likely that the Alans ' influence stretched further westwards , encompassing most of the Sarmatian world , which by then possessed a relatively homogenous culture .
In Steven Spielberg 's 2005 " War of the Worlds " film , the presence of the red weed on Earth is intentional . Once they have a strong hold of the planet , the invaders take captured humans and drain their blood , which act as a fertiliser for the red weed , helping it grow and cover the planet . Spielberg did state that these invaders did not come from Mars ( the " Red Planet " ) , the script indicates the weed is abundantly present on their world as well , suggesting the two share a superficial resemblance . However , what exactly makes up their red weed , whether it is a natural vegetation or what gives it its colour on their world , is unknown ; though the human blood possibly adds to its redness . In one scene , the Tripods used their tentacles to dig fiercely at the ground , which could have been when and how they planted the red weed . It grows so quickly that it can be seen growing , and it can grow on just about anything . It is also stated in the script that the weed is fierce enough to flourish in spite of the conditions that had forced the aliens to find refuge on a new world . But despite its tenacity to survive such a harsh environment , much like in the novel , Earth 's pathogens kill the red weed . Crows eat some of the remains and the rest eventually become an ash-like dust which is blown away in the wind .

A village of 16 houses remained on the ridge , but the vestiges of fortification walls indicated a city had once existed there . A half-century later , on removing the houses , Federico Halbherr and his crew began to discover the remains of an extensive palace complex . As he had begun excavation before Evans at Knossos in 1900 , he did not have the advantage of Arthur Evans ' concepts of Minoan civilization nor the knowledge acquired after the decipherment of the Linear B syllabary by Michael Ventris . Excavation ended in 1904 , to begin again after another half-century , in 1950 . By this time it was understood that the palace had been constructed at the beginning of the Proto-Palace Period , along with all the others .

Porous renders to German WTA specification 2-2-91 can be used as an alternative to dense sand-cement renders . These have a minimum porosity of 40 % of total volume . Salts crystallise in these pores rather than on the plaster surface , avoiding decorative spoiling . Such plasters offer a better solution than dense sand-cement renders when used on moderately salt-contaminated walls as their porous nature gives them insulation properties , resulting in a warmer surface temperature and making condensation problems less likely to occur . However , when used on heavily salt contaminated walls they may need to be replaced frequently as they lose effectiveness once all the pores have become filled with crystallised salt . The " Renovation Mortars " described in EN998-1 : 2003 are described as being designed for use on " moist masonry walls containing soluble salts . " The performance requirements for these types of mortars are based on German WTA specification 2-2-91 but without the requirement for a minimum porosity of 40 % of total volume .

As of 2014 , the current Major League Baseball definition of a perfect game is largely a side effect of the decision made by the major leagues ' Committee for Statistical Accuracy on September 4 , 1991 , to redefine a no-hitter as a game in which the pitcher or pitchers on one team throw a complete game of nine innings or more without surrendering a hit . That decision removed a number of games that had long appeared in the record books : those lasting fewer than nine innings , and those in which a team went hitless in regulation but then got a hit in extra innings . The definition of perfect game was made to parallel this new definition of the no-hitter , in effect substituting " baserunner " for " hit . " As a result of the 1991 redefinition , for instance , Harvey Haddix receives credit for neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter for his performance on May 26 , 1959 , when he threw 12 perfect innings against the Milwaukee Braves before allowing a baserunner in the 13th .

The output is a dispersed liquid or gas , frequently in the form of a fine aerosol or an emulsion .

Davenport writes : " As cinema frees itself from the constraints of the inherently linear celluloid base , a new meta-cinema explodes the myth of the heroic by projecting itself into our everyday environments . The creation and sharing of cinema can happen anywhere , any time . As an improvisational learning partner , meta-cinema invites us to articulate new hypotheses , to sensorially augment our dialogs , to share multi-point of view stories , and to engage in sociable interchange between all people .

The White House 's most famous alleged apparition is that of Abraham Lincoln . One of Mumler 's most famous photographs apparently shows Mary Todd Lincoln with the " ghost " of her husband , Abraham Lincoln . Paranormal researcher Melvyn Willin , in his book " Ghosts Caught on Film , " claims that the photo was taken around 1869 ( after Abraham Lincoln 's death ) , and that Mumler did not know that his sitter was Lincoln , instead believing her to be a ' Mrs Tundall ' . Willin goes on to say that Mumler did not discover who she was until after the photo was developed . The College of Psychic Studies , referencing notes belonging to William Stainton Moses ( who has appeared in photographs by other spirit photographers ) , claim that the photo was taken in the early 1870s , Lincoln had assumed the name of ' Mrs. Lindall ' and that Lincoln had to be encouraged by Mumler 's wife ( a medium ) to identify her husband on the photo .

Bush carried certain states that have not voted for a Republican since , such as Vermont , all of Maine , Connecticut , New Jersey , Delaware , Maryland , Illinois , and California , while Michigan and Pennsylvania would not vote Republican again until 2016 , as did Maine 's 2nd congressional district . Meanwhile , New Mexico wouldn 't vote Republican again until 2004 , and Arkansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Missouri , Nevada , New Hampshire , Ohio , and Tennessee wouldn 't vote Republican again until 2000 . This election was the last time that a Republican was elected president without winning West Virginia . Neither his victory percentage ( 53.4 % ) nor his total electoral votes ( 426 ) have been surpassed in any subsequent presidential election . Barack Obama came closest in the former with 52.9 % in 2008 , and Bill Clinton closest in the latter with 379 electoral votes in 1996 . Bush was the last candidate to receive an absolute majority of the popular vote until his son George W. Bush 's 2004 election . This was the last election to date in which a Republican presidential nominee won a majority of Northern electoral votes , and was also the first election since 1960 when the state of Wisconsin backed the losing candidate as well . This was also the last election until 2016 in which Wisconsin did not vote the same as Illinois . This is the first time a Republican won presidential election without carrying Iowa ( the only other time being the 2000 election ) , the second time a Republican was elected without carrying Oregon ( the first was in the 1868 election ) and the last time a Republican carried any of the contiguous states on the West Coast . The two most closely contested states were Washington , where Dukakis won by less than 2 % of the vote , and Illinois , which Bush won by slightly more than 2 % .

From 1960 to 1976 , due to the political climate changing , development of urban planning in communist China had suffered severe catastrophes : planning institutions had to cease , planners were assigned to support development in rural areas and planning documents were destroyed or discarded . During the Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s , the utopian socialist planning development which particularly overemphasised large-scale urban development was seen as superior to Western-style planning . However , due to the severe limitations of fiscal and labour resources , the first priority of urban planning was given to utopian socialist principles and then the second place to people 's livelihood . Thus , giving little attention to the establishment of residential amenities and facilities , there were significant social and physical imbalances resulting in urban development . Additionally , some anti-urban movements , a typical example being the People 's Commune Movement , took place in communist China during this period . The purpose of setting up a commune , seen as a sub-community within cities , was to spread industrial values from urban to rural areas so that eventually the urban-rural gap would be eliminated .

In the early 1940s Rodezno turned into an open advocate of Don Juan as a future Carlist king , especially once the latter inherited the Alfonsist title after his late father in 1941 . Theoretically this support did not breach the rules of Don Javier 's regency , which permitted forming factions around prospective candidates ; in practice this mattered little , as Rodezno was already expulsed from the Comunión . When the new Alfonsist claimant was assembling a team of collaborators , José María Oriol travelled to meet him in Lausanne to suggest ( in vain ) that Rodezno is nominated the official Alfonsist representative in Spain . In the mid-1940s Fal mounted an offensive offering various Carlist regentialist solutions to Franco ; as a response , in April 1945 Rodezno travelled to Portugal to meet Don Juan and prepare ground for his Carlist legitimization . The initiative bore fruit in February 1946 , when the Alfonsist claimant signed a Rodezno co-drafted document , intended to confirm his Traditionalist spirit . Known as " Bases institucionales para la restauracion de la monarquia " or simply as " Bases de Estoril , " it outlined the basics of the future monarchy . They very much resembled the Traditionalist principles , though the document fell short of declaring Don Juan the legitimate Carlist claimant .
On 10 September , both fleets got underway . " Detroit " fired the first shot around noon , while still out of range . Perry formed the fleet into a line , with the larger ships each being assigned a target : " Lawrence " to " Detroit , " " Niagara " to " Queen Charlotte , " and " Caledonia " to . As the line moved to engage , " Niagara , " under the command of Elliott , lagged behind the fleet . The cause of the failure of " Niagara " to maintain formation is unknown , either deliberate on the part of Elliott , or because it was becalmed . After a couple of hours , all of the cannons on " Lawrence " that were facing the British were out of commission and the brig could no longer be maneuvered . Perry lowered his battle flag , emblazoned with the last words of Captain James Lawrence , " Don 't Give Up The Ship , " and transferred to the still-intact " Niagara " via a small rowboat . Perry took command of " Niagara " and crossed the British line perpendicularly in a tactic called crossing the " T. " " Queen Charlotte , " while attempting to prevent " Niagara " from breaking through the line , collided with " Detroit " and became entangled . " Niagara " opened fire with both broadsides : the starboard broadside hitting " Queen Charlotte " and " Detroit , " and the port into " Lady Prevost . " After several broadsides , " Queen Charlotte " surrendered , followed shortly after by " Detroit " and the rest of the British fleet .

The Persian Gulf is home to over 700 species of fish , most of which are native . Of these 700 species , more than 80 % are reef associated . These reefs are primarily rocky , but there are also a few coral reefs . Compared to the Red Sea , the coral reefs in the Persian Gulf are relatively few and far between . This is primarily connected to the influx of major rivers , especially the Shatt al-Arab ( Euphrates and Tigris ) , which carry large amounts of sediment ( most reef-building corals require strong light ) and causes relatively large variations in temperature and salinity ( corals in general are poorly suited to large variations ) . Nevertheless , coral reefs have been found along sections of coast of all countries in the Persian gulf . Corals are vital ecosystems that support multitude of marine species , and whose health directly reflects the health of the Persian gulf . Recent years have seen a drastic decline in the coral population in the Persian gulf , partially owing to global warming but majorly due to irresponsible dumping by Arab states like the UAE and Bahrain . Construction garbage such as tires , cement , and chemical by products have found their way to the Persian Gulf in recent years . Aside from direct damage to the coral , the construction waste creates " traps " for marine life in which they are trapped and die . The end result has been a dwindling population of the coral , and as a result a decrease in number of species that rely on the corals for their survival .

Mbiti also found that when an individual dies , his soul or spirit wanders until the body is given a proper burial . This waiting period is called the transitional period of the deceased . Christianity arrived in Igbo land in 1857 , conjuring fear within the Igbo that if they became Christians their god would bring disaster to them . Others also refused to convert to Christianity because of the belief that Christian missionaries were there to destroy the Igbo religion . Christians attacked the traditional song music and dance of the Igbo religion as they deemed it immoral . This set the stage for religious conflict between the Igbo and the Christians , which might have led to the inference that African traditional religions were rooted in anti-Christian belief . Elders were merely protecting their traditions . One of Mbiti 's most famous quotes in his book " African Religions and Philosophy " was :

The IOE design allows the use of larger valves than a sidevalve ( or L-head ) or overhead valve engine . Its advantages over the sidevalve / flathead also include a compact combustion chamber , a well-located spark plug , and a cooling effect from the mixture swirl , along with better intake mixture flow . Disadvantages include a combustion chamber of more complex shape than that of an overhead valve engine , which affects combustion rates and can create hot spots in the piston head , and inferior valve location , which hinders efficient scavenging . Due to the added complications of rocker arms and pushrods , it is also more complex and expensive to make than a sidevalve engine , as well as being physically larger due to the rocker arms being placed over the cylinder head , and it requires an inlet valve and ports in the cylinder head , while the cylinder of a sidevalve engine is simply a closed-end cylinder .

The Japan Punch has made a considerable impact and influence on Japanese comic art or manga . It is considered as the first comic magazine to appear in Japan. and historians frequently regard the publication as a prototype for Japanese political cartoons but also for manga as well . Wirgman , along with George Bigot is credited for introducing or bringing the conventions or elements of modern comics to Japan and for the introduction of speech balloons or bubbles , which shaped the conventions of manga . Historian , John Clark suggests that the Japan Punch introduced the European notion of 19th century visual satire to Japan to which he explains as once regarded as a visually absurd and grotesque practice that was prohibited in Japan . He also suggests that the publication had an influence on Kobayashi Kiyochika in the Mamoru Chibun , a Japanese satirical newspaper which featured speech bubbles and wild linguistic and visual puns , similar to those of the Japan Punch . Its significance extends to the extent that ' ponchi ' ( punch ) , a Japanese word derived from the name of the title of the publication has replaced words that previously meant caricature Hence , many people consider Wirgman and the Punch as a precursor of modern comics as it effectively established the ' punch ' genre in Japan . To this day , there is an annual ceremony honouring Wirgman at his grave in Yokohama .

The family Homolidae , known as carrier crabs or porter crabs , contains 14 genera of marine crabs . They mostly live on the continental slope and continental shelf , and are rarely encountered . Members of the Homolidae have their fifth pereiopods ( last pair of walking legs ) in a sub-dorsal position , which allows them to hold objects in place over the rear half of the carapace . The objects carried include sponges , black corals and gorgonians , and this behaviour may be a defence mechanism against predators . Some species have been observed carrying living sea urchins in a symbiotic relationship which allows them to benefit from the protection of the urchin 's dangerous spikes .

Such techniques of applying geometrical constructions to algebraic problems were also adopted by a number of Renaissance mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano and Niccolò Fontana " Tartaglia " on their studies of the cubic equation . The geometrical approach to construction problems , rather than the algebraic one , was favored by most 16th and 17th century mathematicians , notably Blaise Pascal who argued against the use of algebraic and analytical methods in geometry . The French mathematicians Franciscus Vieta and later René Descartes and Pierre de Fermat revolutionized the conventional way of thinking about construction problems through the introduction of coordinate geometry . They were interested primarily in the properties of " algebraic curves , " such as those defined by Diophantine equations ( in the case of Fermat ) , and the algebraic reformulation of the classical Greek works on conics and cubics ( in the case of Descartes ) .

A further point of uncertainty is whether these names represent distinct minor entities , or epithets pertaining to an aspect of a major deity 's sphere of influence , that is , an indigitation , or name intended to " fix " or focalize the action of the god so invoked . If the former , the " indigitamenta " might be described as indexing " significant names which bespoke a specialized divine function , " for which the German term " Sondergötter " is sometimes used ; for instance , Vagitanus gives the newborn its first cry " ( vagitus ) . " If the " indigitamenta " record invocational epithets , however , an otherwise obscure deity such as Robigus , the red god of wheat rust , should perhaps be understood as an indigitation of Mars , red god of war and agriculture ; Maia , " a deity known apparently only to the priests and the learned , " would be according to Macrobius an indigitation of the Bona Dea . Roscher , however , does not consider Robigus and Maia to have been part of the " indigitamenta . "

Pat Carroll lined out at number 11 , but was soon replaced by Declan Fogarty . ( This would turn out to be the last glimpse of Pat Carroll on the hurling field ) . In Croke Park , 90 miles to the south , Galway were meanwhile de-throning the Rebels in a pulsating game , setting up a repeat of the classic decider of 1981 . The Final took place at GAA Headquarters on 1 September , and saw Galway tearing into the game at a frantic pace , only to squander many scoring chances . Ten of Galway 's 19 wides came in the opening 20 minutes . Having absorbed ferocious pressure , Offaly settled into their own game-plan . Eugene Coughlan kept Galway full forward Noel Lane from repeating the damage Lane had done against Cork . Brendan Bermingham effectively marked another of Galway 's Semi-final stars , 21-year-old Tony Keady ( who had lost his father that August ) . Padraig Horan at full forward distributed very effectively , and the other Offaly forwards tacked on points when it mattered . Midway through the first half , Joe Dooley raced in to hand-pass past Galway custodian Peter Murphy , only for it to be adjudged a square infringement . However , Pat Cleary darted through to score two crucial goals , the second of which ( early in the second half ) seemed to put Offaly in the driving seat . Then PJ Molloy at wing forward and Joe Cooney at midfield initiated a comeback by the Tribesmen . When Michael " Hopper " McGrath lobbed a ball in , Molloy leapt highest before rifling a sublime goal to the roof of the net . Another Galway goal , from Joe Cooney 's long-range effort , was not given when Jim Troy let fly to clear the ball from just inside his goal-line . Brendan Keeshan was introduced to take on Cooney . The mentors made wholesale switches in the closing stages , and Offaly emerged victorious by 2-11 to 1-12 .

An inclined plane consists of a cradle ( to hold a barge ) or caisson ( a box full of water in which a barge can float ) which moves on rails sideways up a slope from one waterway to the other . Since the box is " wet " ( filled with water ) , Archimedes ' principle ensures that the caisson always weighs the same , regardless of the size of boat being carried ( or even if it contains only water ) . This makes for easy counterbalancing by a fixed weight or by a second caisson . The motive power may be steam or hydraulic , or may come from overbalancing the top caisson with extra water from the upper waterway .

In the 1960s and 1970s , " social history " caught the imagination of a young generation of historians . It became a central concept - and a rallying point - of historiographic revisionism . It meant many things at the same time . It gave priority to the study of particular kinds of phenomena , such as classes and movements , urbanization and industrialization , family and education , work and leisure , mobility , inequality , conflicts and revolutions . It stressed structures and processes over actors and events . It emphasized analytical approaches close to the social sciences rather than by the traditional methods of historical hermeneutics . Frequently social historians sympathized with the causes ( as they saw them ) of the little people , of the underdog , of popular movements , or of the working class . Social history was both demanded and rejected as a vigorous revisionist alternative to the more established ways of historiography , in which the reconstruction of politics and ideas , the history of events and hermeneutic methods traditionally dominated .

This distinction is essential when it comes to resolving inefficiencies that are caused by externalities .

During these years , his wife remained with his parents in Ratangarh , while Poddar lived in Kolkata in a community hostel with other young Marwadi men who were also working in trade . This arrangement was standard and typical of the Kolkata Marwadi ethos of that day . It was in this milieu that Poddar came into contact with some Bengali young men of a revolutionary bent . In those days , Bengal was the cradle of armed struggle against British rule , and Kolkata was still the first city of India. the hostel in which Poddar lived began to be used as a safe house by certain revolutionary youth . Poddar had little knowledge and no involvement in these activities . Nevertheless , when the police finally raided the hostel , he and every other young man living there was tarred with the same brush as the revolutionaries . Although he was not accused in court of having committed any violent act , the British authorities jailed him for several months , pending trial , merely for having been in contact with the nationalist revolutionaries . This term in jail , for no actual offence , proved to be a turning point in Poddar 's life . Although his family 's business was flourishing , Poddar lost interest in pursuing trade . Instead , his inclination turned towards nationalism .

Forecasting a probable timing , location , magnitude and other important features of a forthcoming seismic event is called earthquake prediction . Various attempts have been made by seismologists and others to create effective systems for precise earthquake predictions , including the VAN method . Most seismologists do not believe that a system to provide timely warnings for individual earthquakes has yet been developed , and many believe that such a system would be unlikely to give useful warning of impending seismic events . However , more general forecasts routinely predict seismic hazard . Such forecasts estimate the probability of an earthquake of a particular size affecting a particular location within a particular time-span , and they are routinely used in earthquake engineering .
In the excerpt from " Poetics of Relation , " " The Open Boat , " Glissant 's imagery was particularly compelling when describing the slave experience and the linkage between a slave and the homeland and the slave and the unknown . This poem paralleled Dionne Brand 's book in calling the " Door of No Return " an Infinite Abyss . This image conveys emptiness sparked by unknown identity as it feels deep and endless . " The Open Boat " also discussed the phenomenon of " falling into the belly of the whale " which elicits many references and meanings . This image parallels the Biblical story of Jonah and the Whale , realizing the gravity of biblical references as the Bible was used as justification for slavery . More literally , Glissant related the boat to a whale as it " devoured your existence . " As each word a poet chooses is specifically chosen to aid in furthering the meaning of the poem , the word " Falling " implies an unintentional and undesirable action . This lends to the experience of the slaves on the ship as they were confined to an overcrowded , filthy , and diseased existence among other slaves , all there against their will . All of Glissant 's primary images in this poem elicit the feeling of endlessness , misfortune , and ambiguity , which were arguably the future existence of the slaves on ships to " unknown land . "

The implication of phosphoglycolate phosphatase in the regulation of 2,3-PGA suggests the importance of having a functional version of the enzyme . In all animal tissues , 2,3-PGA is important as the cofactor of the glycolytic enzyme , phosphoglycerate mutase . More important , the synthesis and breakdown of 2,3-PGA is critical to regulation of hemoglobin 's binding affinity to oxygen , and an increase in its concentration leads to increased tissue oxygenation while a decrease may lead to tissue hypoxia . Therefore , the activation of the enzyme responsible for the metabolic breakdown of 2,3-PGA by phosphoglycolate could implicate phosphoglycolate phosphatase in the regulation of 2,3-PGA concentrations .

Drawing on the work of earlier writers such as Walter Burkert and Paul Friedrich , Tuite described mythological similarities between Dali and several other similar goddesses possibly descended from the Proto-Indo-European Ausos , such as the Greek goddesses Aphrodite and Eos , the Sumerian Inanna , and the Babylonian Ishtar . Foremost among these similarities are an association with gold ( both as a color and as a precious metal ) , fertility and patronage of animals , seductive behavior combined with destructive jealousy , and a connection to dawn or the morning star . All together , he refers to these similarities as the " dawn goddess complex . " Tuite identifies the overarching theme of the dawn goddess complex as ambiguity and transition . He notes that the mythological associations of these goddesses serve as symbols for larger concepts such as transitions between night to day , old to new , and birth to death . In Dali 's case , her identification with both the morning star and New Year 's Eve directly reinforce her status as a patron of transitions .

According to several articles and news sites , the Philippines faced a power supply shortage leading to rolling blackouts across the country during the years 2014-2015 . In late 2014 , President Aquino requested the Congress to pass a resolution giving him emergency power to allow the government to provide additional supply and prevent a power shortage in 2015 . However , the passing of the resolution was delayed and Aquino admitted that his original plan was no longer feasible . His proposal was tweaked and the Interruptible Load Program ( ILP ) was recommended for use in the Luzon power grid instead . The ILP essentially enrolls large establishments , including government owned and controlled corporations , with their own generators to voluntarily disconnect from the main grid and switch to their generators instead when a power outage was predicted . Their rationale was that a power outage would cause these establishments to run on generators anyway so it is more beneficial for them to run their generators in an organized fashion .

Yeakel won the five-way primary with 45 % of the vote , easily defeating the endorsed candidate , Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel , in an election cycle dubbed by pundits as the " year of the woman . " Polls put her ahead of Specter by double digits . But Specter ran a campaign that was praised by political analysts for being almost flawless .

It did not help matters that a newspaper strike in Pittsburgh crippled Yeakel 's ability to introduce herself to voters in the southwest .

Random microsatellite primers can be developed by cloning random segments of DNA from the focal species . These random segments are inserted into a plasmid or bacteriophage vector , which is in turn implanted into " Escherichia coli " bacteria . Colonies are then developed , and screened with fluorescently-labelled oligonucleotide sequences that will hybridize to a microsatellite repeat , if present on the DNA segment . If positive clones can be obtained from this procedure , the DNA is sequenced and PCR primers are chosen from sequences flanking such regions to determine a specific locus . This process involves significant trial and error on the part of researchers , as microsatellite repeat sequences must be predicted and primers that are randomly isolated may not display significant polymorphism . Microsatellite loci are widely distributed throughout the genome and can be isolated from semi-degraded DNA of older specimens , as all that is needed is a suitable substrate for amplification through PCR .

Classification generally has four phase . The first stage of classification is a health examination . For amputees in this class , this is often done on site at a sports training facility or competition . The second stage is observation in practice , the third stage is observation in competition and the last stage is assigning the sportsperson to a relevant class . Sometimes the health examination may not be done on site for amputees because the nature of the amputation could cause not physically visible alterations to the body . This is especially true for lower limb amputees as it relates to how their limbs align with their hips and the impact this has on their spine and how their skull sits on their spine . For wheelchair basketball , part of the classification process involves observing a player during practice or training . This often includes observing them go one on one against some one who is likely to be in the same class the player would be classified into . Once a player is classified , it is very hard to be classified into a different classification . Players have been known to have issues with classification because some players play down their abilities during the classification process . At the same time , as players improve at the game , movements become regular and their skill level improves . This can make it appear like their classification was incorrect .

Chromium ( III ) chlorides display the somewhat unusual property of existing in a number of distinct chemical forms ( isomers ) , which differ in terms of the number of chloride anions that are coordinated to Cr ( III ) and the water of crystallization . The different forms exist both as solids , and in aqueous solutions . Several members are known of the series of [ CrCl ( HO ) ] . The main hexahydrate can be more precisely described as [ CrCl ( HO ) ] Cl . It consists of the cation trans- [ CrCl ( HO ) ] and additional molecules of water and a chloride anion in the lattice . Two other hydrates are known , pale green [ CrCl ( HO ) ] Cl and violet [ Cr ( HO ) ] Cl . Similar behaviour occurs with other chromium ( III ) compounds .

By the end of 1854 , Wagner had sketched out all three acts of an opera on the Tristan theme , based on Gottfried von Strassburg 's telling of the story . While the earliest extant sketches date from December 1856 , it was not until August 1857 that Wagner began devoting his attention entirely to the opera , putting aside the composition of " Siegfried " to do so . On 20 August he began the prose sketch for the opera , and the libretto ( or " poem , " as Wagner preferred to call it ) was completed by September 18 . Wagner , at this time , had moved into a cottage built in the grounds of Wesendonck 's villa , where , during his work on " Tristan und Isolde , " he became passionately involved with Mathilde Wesendonck . Whether or not this relationship was platonic remains uncertain . One evening in September of that year , Wagner read the finished poem of " Tristan " to an audience including his wife , Minna , his current muse , Mathilde , and his future mistress ( and later wife ) , Cosima von Bülow .

Glucose was first isolated from raisins in 1747 by the German chemist Andreas Marggraf . Glucose was discovered in grapes by Johann Tobias Lowitz in 1792 and recognized as different from cane sugar ( sucrose ) . Glucose is the term coined by Jean Baptiste Dumas in 1838 , which has prevailed in the chemical literature . Friedrich August Kekulé proposed the term dextrose ( from Latin dexter = right ) , because in aqueous solution of glucose , the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right . In contrast , -fructose ( a ketohexose ) and -glucose turn linearly polarized light to the left . The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light ( " d " and " l " -nomenclature ) was later abandoned in favor of the - and -notation , which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group , and in concordance with the configuration of - or -glyceraldehyde .

They were the first to drop from the penalty box to pick up the ball in midfield , switch to the flanks , attract and disorientate the central defenders with their runs , their accelerations , their dribbling . " Nicknamed " Baixinho " ( Portuguese for " The Little One , " or " Shorty " ) Romário was an extremely agile player , who possessed excellent balance on the ball , and significant strength in spite of his small stature , which made him particularly effective in tight spaces in the penalty area , and allowed him to retain possession of the ball when put under pressure by larger players ; his low centre of gravity and quick bursts of acceleration enabled him to outrun opponents over short distances and beat defenders with sudden turns or changes of pace , while his technique and finishing saw him score goals with powerful and accurate first-time strikes - notably toe-pokes with little back-lift . His ball control and dribbling skills saw him use elaborate feints , such as : dragging the ball around a defender without it leaving his foot , and the flip flap .

In Dutch and the Scandinavian languages there is an unofficial trend toward splitting compound words , known in Norwegian as " særskriving , " in Swedish as " särskrivning " ( literally " separate writing " ) , and in Dutch as " Engelse ziekte " ( the " English disease " ) . Because the Scandinavian languages rely heavily on the distinction between the compound word and the sequence of the separate words it consists of , this has serious implications . For example , the adjective " røykfritt " ( literally " smokefree , " meaning no smoking allowed ) if separated into its composite parts , would mean " røyk fritt " ( " smoke freely " ) . In Dutch , compounds written with spaces may also be confused , but can also be interpreted as a sequence of a noun and a genitive ( which is unmarked in Dutch ) in formal abbreviated writing . This may lead to , for example , " commissie vergadering " ( " commission meeting " ) being read as " commission of the meeting " rather than " meeting of the commission " ( normally spelled " commissievergadering " ) .

Even as the XF-108 program was progressing well , there were signs that would ultimately lead to its eventual cancellation . Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats , the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s , as well as rising costs , contributed to the termination of the XF-108 . The cancellation was announced on 23 September 1959 . North American continued refining the design through 1960 in hopes that the program might be revived . Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier , it was not wholly in vain ; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy , which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft , retained the fuselage / weapon package and systems design of the Rapier . In many ways the Vigilante could be seen as the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design .

While his colleagues saw football as a marketing and public relation investment and were quite ready to siphon funds out of their main business to keep their teams afloat and replenish their player roster Spinelli saw Genoa as another business whose main aim was that of generating revenue for its owner ( namely , himself ) and so was more than happy to sell esteemed players for hefty revenues of which just a minimal fraction was then re-invested in the team , often for the acquisition of lesser-valued replacements or virtual unknowns . Thus he proved all-too-eager to sell Uruguayan striker Carlos Aguilera and to replace him with the markedly inferior Kazuyoshi Miura from the Japanese Yomiuri Verdy ( a deal that especially pleased him since the Japanese sponsors were actually paying him to let Miura play in Italian Serie A ) . < br >

Another interesting usage of LOADALL , laid out in the book " The Design of OS / 2 , " would have been to allow running former real-mode programs in 16-bit protected mode , as utilized by Digital Research 's Concurrent DOS 286 since 1985 , as well as FlexOS 286 and IBM 4680 OS since 1986 . Marking all the descriptor caches in the GDT and LDTs " not present " would allow the operating system to trap segment-register reloads , as well as attempts at performing real-mode-specific " segment arithmetic " and emulate the desired behavior by updating the segment descriptors ( LOADALL again ) . This " virtual 8086 mode " for the 80286 was , however , too slow to be practical . The idea had to be mostly discarded , furthermore , due to errata in some early Intel 80286 processors before the E-2 stepping . As a result , OS / 2 1.x - and Windows in " standard " mode as well - had to run DOS programs in real mode . Nevertheless , the idea was not lost ; it led Intel to introduce the virtual mode of the 80386 , allowing the implementation of " DOS boxes " at last in a relatively efficient and documented way .

For example - one can tell someone to " go to buggery , " which is a slightly stronger equivalent to the American expression " take a hike . " The adverb " buggered " is also widely used and often refers to a broken or defective object ( " my car 's buggered " ) or is used as a means of expressing tiredness or exhaustion ( " I 'm buggered after that bushwalk " ) . The word can also be used as an expression of lack , such as in the phrase " There 's bugger-all ( money ) left in the bank . " But this novel range of usages is evidently only inoffensive in Australia , and the use of the word " buggery " in the series title was a source of some amazement to overseas guests such as Canadian comedian Mike Myers .

There is much inconsistency when it comes to economic returns to a second major . The greatest gains in earnings come when the two majors are in different fields ( hypo-specialization ) , with the highest returns being among those who opt for technical majors . An arts / social science or education pairing with a business or math / science has greater earning potential than a single arts / social science or education major - although , adding an arts / social science or education major with a business or math / science degree offers no greater rewards than a single major in either of those fields . On the contrary , it appears that an education and math / science pairing results in " lower " earnings compared to a single math / science major . The greatest earnings appear to be for those who opt for an engineering- math / science pairing . Compared to those with only the math / science major , double majors have returns of up to 30 percentage points . The most profitable second majors , regardless of the first major , appear to be Business and Administration , Computer Science , and Engineering . In some cases , gender appears to matter greatly . Female engineering-math / science double majors , for example , have greater earning returns than males . On the other hand , Males do not suffer the earnings penalty that female education double majors often do . Differences in earnings also appear across types of institutions . Liberal Arts colleges , where close to a third of students have two majors , the return to earnings are small and insignificant . In contrast , a 3.9 % premium appears for double majors from Research institutions , where less than a quarter of students add a second major .

Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model . Consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent years , yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone , as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first . Dell 's rivals in the PC industry , HP , Gateway and Acer , had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift . The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell 's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3 players . Dell responded by experimenting with mall kiosks , plus quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York .

Autonomy and informed consent are important when considering the future uses of xenotransplantation . A patient undergoing xenotransplantation should be fully aware of the procedure and should have no outside force influencing their choice . The patient should understand the risks and benefits of such a transplantation . However , it has been suggested that friends and family members should also give consent , because the repercussions of transplantation are high , with the potential of diseases and viruses crossing over to humans from the transplantation . Close contacts are at risk for such infections . Monitoring of close relations may also be required to ensure that xenozoonosis is not occurring . The question then becomes : does the autonomy of the patient become limited based on the willingness or unwillingness of friends and family to give consent , and are the principles of confidentiality broken ?

While some believe that Trump administration 's increase of tariffs on China may help defend American economic interests , it can be argued as well that it would escalate trade barriers between these nations and cause negative effects within the US . According to Forbes , US tariffs might be raised to impact over $ 200 billion worth of imports , including consumer goods and smart products ( LEDs , thermometers etc . ) . These smart devices can utilize sensors that communicate usage information to consumers and businesses . In turn , this data can help these parties reduce their environmental footprint . However , since the devices are primarily manufactured in China , tariffs on these products would cause their manufacturers to incur higher operating and transportation costs . In turn , these businesses would raise prices for US consumers on their respective products . For example , Rad Power Bikes ( an electric bike manufacturer ) is considering raising their bike prices by $ 200 because a tariff is being considered for electric bikes . Consumers should not be driven away from purchasing these vehicles , since they can help reduce congestion and tailpipe emissions within US cities . Similarly , tariffs can cause price increases on devices such as light bulbs and smart meters , which have been shown to reduce consumer energy costs by 80 % . Since tariffs on China are shown to potentially curb US consumer adoption of environmentally-friendly smart devices , they could cause both negative economic and environmental effects within the US .

William Bouguereau chooses to portray the characters of Cupid and Psyche as young children , almost babies . Cupid , the Roman interpretation of Eros , is often portrayed as a fantastic , mischievous winged baby with a bow and arrow . Eros , the Greek equivalent , is often depicted as a young man , which is when the love affair between him and Psyche plays out . Instead , we see Cupid as a baby , Psyche is also portrayed as a young child , though typically through art history she is seen as a young woman . Bouguereau chooses to paint her with butterfly wings , for psyche was the Greek word given to butterflies by Aristotle . Psyche is a symbol to the transformation of the human soul , as she transforms from human to immortal . The decision to paint the characters as children is a reference to their innocence , before the corruption of their affair by Venus . This depiction would have been widely accepted in the Salon it was shown at . Bouguereau applied this story in multiple paintings of his , depicting them as the young lovers we are more familiar with .

Steve rightly took umbrage over his portrayal and what he saw as a grotesque betrayal of confidences , while I was equally distraught by the way in which material I had arduously gathered for a book about Apple was siphoned , filtered , and poisoned with a gossipy benzene by an editor in New York whose regular task was to chronicle the wayward world of rock-and-roll music . Steve made no secret of his anger and left a torrent of messages on the answering machine I kept in my converted earthquake cottage at the foot of San Francisco 's Potrero Hill . He , understandably , banished me from Apple and forbade anyone in his orbit to talk to me . The experience made me decide that I would never again work anywhere I could not exert a large amount of control over my own destiny or where I would be paid by the word . I finished my leave [ and ] published my book , " The Little Kingdom : The Private Story of Apple Computer , " which I felt , unlike the unfortunate magazine article , presented a balanced portrait of the young Steve Jobs .

The independent development of art and architecture in the nineteenth century relied on the architect 's view of them as separate entities . Nevertheless , new artistic ideas of pragmatics and materiality did penetrate through a purist architectural approach , evident in the work of W.R. Lethaby and Ernest Newton . This development encouraged the division of architects with a common value of craftsmanship but in opposition on acceptance of traditional forms . Those abandoning traditional forms promoted the idea of a synthesis of the house and its contents with one designer for both . The Glasgow Movement pioneered by Charles Rennie Mackintosh expanded this idea , emphasizing design as colour , form and atmosphere .

While there are no definitive data showing that long-duration space flight is associated with cardiac arrhythmias , there are observational data that have been documented over many years that are suggestive of cardiac electrical changes during long flights . For example , during Skylab , all 9 American crewmembers exhibited some form of rhythm disturbance . Most of these rhythm disturbances consisted of single PVCs and were clinically insignificant . However , one crewmember experienced a 5-beat run of ventricular tachycardia during a lower-body negative pressure protocol , and another had periods of " wandering supraventricular pacemaker " during rest and following exercise . More recently , it has been shown that the corrected QT interval ( QTc ) , a marker of ventricular repolarization , was prolonged slightly in a small number of astronauts after long-duration space flight . In-flight Holter monitoring was not performed during these space flights . Thus , it is not known whether this prolongation was associated with any known arrhythmias .

Rowan Williams , Archbishop of Canterbury , stated that " [ it ] will inevitably have a significant impact on the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be .

Justice Rehnquist suggests , instead , that one turn to the actions of the Congress and James Madison 's significant role in it for insight into the original intent of the Establishment Clause . He continues by referencing the debates of the colonies ' ratification conventions . He points out the fact that the states frequently opposed the ratification of the Constitution due to its lack of a Bill of Rights . Those who , upon that basis , opposed ratification thought that the government , without such an enumeration of rights , had a great potential to follow the authoritarian path they wished to avoid . To solve this impasse , Madison urged Congress to consider his draft of amendments . After some time of debate and revision , a version what is now the First Amendment was created : " No religion shall be established by law , nor shall the equal rights of conscience be infringed . " This version was met with opposition by many representatives as it could be construed " to abolish religion altogether " or " to be taken in such latitude as to be extremely hurtful to the cause of religion . " It was on this basis that the final version of the amendment was selected and ratified . Thus , says Rehnquist , one can see indisputably that the spirit in which the Congress approved the Establishment Clause was one of open-minded toleration , not one of hostility towards religion .

The Konsul was a wood framed aircraft with a high , cantilever , single spar wing with stressed 3-ply covering from the spar to the leading edge and fabric covered aft . It was built in three parts , an 8 m ( 26 ft 3 in ) inner section with a box spar and outer panels with an I-section one . The wing had a thick and strongly cambered profile , using the then new Göttingen 535 airfoil with its high lift to drag ratio that attracted many pre-World War II sailplane designers . The long wings had constant chord except for tapered tips , where the wing decreased in thickness . There was no dihedral . Half span , large area ailerons had angled hinges attached to the spar at its tip and , in the early flight tests , projected well beyond the fixed wing tip . These proved both heavy in flight and vulnerable on the ground , so were soon tapered and rounded off , slightly reducing the span and aspect ratio . The ailerons operated differentially , upward deflections being smaller than downward ones ; this was a relatively new way of reducing adverse yaw but in addition the rudder and ailerons were interconnected . Small rudder deflections did not affect the ailerons but larger ones moved them appropriately . No flaps , airbrakes or spoilers were fitted , normal for the time

In Babylonia , in place of the " bas relief , " there is greater use of three-dimensional figures in the round - the earliest examples being the statues from Girsu , that are realistic if somewhat clumsy . The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious , and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting . Two seal-cylinders from the age of Sargon of Akkad are among the best examples of their kind . One of the first remarkable specimens of early metallurgy to be discovered by archaeologists is the silver vase of Entemena . At a later epoch , great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such jewellery as earrings and bracelets of gold . Copper , too , was worked with skill ; indeed , it is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working .

The financial struggles faced by many later Games , such as the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , have led to more positive re-appraisals of the management of the 1996 Games . Former JPMorgan Chase president ( and torchbearer ) Kabir Sehgal noted that in contrast to many later Games , the 1996 Olympics were financially viable , had a positive economic impact on the city , and most of the facilities constructed for the Games still see use in the present day . Sehgal contrasted the Games ' bid - a " grassroots " effort backed almost entirely by private funding , with the only significant public spending coming from infrastructure associated with the Games - to modern " top-down " bids , instigated by local governments and reliant on taxpayer funding , making them unpopular among citizens who may not necessarily be interested .

The dynastic name Later Jin was a direct reference to the Jin dynasty founded by the Jurchen people , who ruled northern China from 1115 to 1234 . As such , the name was likely to be viewed as closely tied to the Jurchens and would perhaps evoke hostility from Chinese who viewed the Song dynasty , rival state to the Jin , as the legitimate rulers of China at that time . Hong Taiji 's ambition was to conquer China proper and overthrow the Ming dynasty , and to do that required not only a powerful military force but also an effective bureaucratic administration . For this , he used the obvious model , that of the Ming government , and recruited Ming officials to his cause . If the name of Later Jin would prove an impediment to his goal among many Chinese , then it was not too much to change it . At the same time , Hong Taiji conquered the territory north of Shanhai pass by Ming Dynasty and Ligdan Khan in Inner Mongolia . He won one of the Yuan Dynasty 's imperial jade seal ( Chinese : ) and a golden Buddha called " Mahakala . " In April 1636 , Mongol nobility of Inner Mongolia , Manchu nobility and the Han mandarin held the Kurultai in Shenyang , recommended khan of Later Jin to be the emperor of Great Qing empire . Russian archive contains translations of the 1636 year Hong Taiji decree with the provision that after the fall of the Qing dynasty Mongols will return to their previous laws , i.e. independence Whatever the precise motivation , Hong Taiji proclaimed the establishment of the Qing dynasty and also changed his era name to Chóngdé in 1636 . The reasons for the choice of Qing as the new name are likewise unclear , although it has been speculated that the sound - Jin and Qing are pronounced similarly in Manchu - or " wuxing " theory - traditional ideas held that fire , associated with the character for Ming , was overcome by water , associated with the character for Qing - may have influenced the choice . Another possible reason may be that Hong Taiji changed the name of the dynasty from ( Later ) Jin to Qing in 1636 because of internecine fraternal struggle and skirmish between brothers and half brothers for the throne .

From 1981 , the NUM was led by Arthur Scargill , a militant trade unionist and socialist , with strong leanings towards communism . Scargill was a vocal opponent of Thatcher 's government . In March 1983 , he stated " The policies of this government are clear - to destroy the coal industry and the NUM . " Scargill wrote in the NUM journal " The Miner " : " Waiting in the wings , wishing to chop us to pieces , is Yankee steel butcher MacGregor . This 70-year-old multi-millionaire import , who massacred half the steel workforce in less than three years , is almost certainly brought in to wield the axe on pits . It 's now or never for Britain 's mineworkers . This is the final chance - while we still have the strength - to save our industry . " On 12 May 1983 , in response to being questioned on how he would respond if the Conservatives were re-elected in the general election , Scargill replied : " My attitude would be the same as the attitude of the working class in Germany when the Nazis came to power . It does not mean that because at some stage you elect a government that you tolerate its existence . You oppose it . " He also said he would oppose a second-term Thatcher government " as vigorously as I possibly can . " After the election , in a speech to the NUM conference in Perth on 4 July 1983 , Scargill called for extra-parliamentary action against the Conservative government :

It is in this sense that traditional power is psychological and not historical ; since traditional power is not entirely based on a commitment to some linear historical creed , but rather , on mere habit . Moreover , traditional power need not be based on actual history , but rather be based on imagined or fabricated history . Thus he writes that " Both religious and secular innovators - at any rate those who have had most lasting success - have appealed , as far as they could , to tradition , and have done whatever lay in their power to minimise the elements of novelty in their system . " ( Russell 1938 : 40 )

A " shortie " wetsuit may be worn over a full wetsuit for added warmth . Some vendors sell a very similar item and refer to it as a ' core warmer ' when worn over another wetsuit . A " skin " may also be worn under a wetsuit . This practice started with divers wearing body tights under a wetsuit for extra warmth and to make donning and removing the wetsuit easier . A " skin " may also be as an undersuit beneath a drysuit in temperatures where a full undersuit is not necessary .
As the number of inmates at the hospital grew , it strained the local road network 's ability to carry food and other supplies . Farmer Charles Smith owned a number of fields around the area , and dredged his irrigation canal deep enough for barges . It ran to a point just north of the hospital .

The out-of-pocket fee amount for a doctor 's visit or treatment in the primary health care is set at a maximum of EUR 13.70 ( in 2010 ) and the amount varies from one local authority to another . Hospital out-patients pay EUR 27.40 per consultation ; in-patients pay a per diem charge of EUR 32.50 . For long-term illnesses , the charges are based largely on income . Although a vital part for health financing and provision , the current system of the user fees has been discussed to contribute to the inequities in the access of health services among the low-income residents .
Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal . Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg / dL ( 17 µmol / L ) and levels over 2-3 mg / dL ( 34-51 µmol / L ) typically results in jaundice . High bilirubin is divided into two types : unconjugated ( indirect ) and conjugated ( direct ) . Conjugated bilirubin can be confirmed by finding bilirubin in the urine . Other conditions that can cause yellowish skin but are not jaundice include carotenemia from eating large amounts of certain foods containing carotene and medications like rifampin .

MMP-23 belongs to the family of zinc- and calcium-dependent matrix metalloproteases . It is anchored in the cell membrane by an N-terminal prodomain , and it contains three extracellular domains : catalytic metalloprotease domain , ShK domain and immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule ( Ig-CaM ) domain . The prodomain traps the voltage-gated potassium channel K1.3 , but not the closely related K1.2 channel , in the endoplasmic reticulum . Studies with chimeras suggest that the prodomain interacts with the K1.3 region from the S5 transmembrane segment to the C terminus . NMR studies of the prodomain reveal a single trans-membrane alpha-helix , joined by a short linker to a juxta-membrane alpha-helix , which is associated with the surface of the membrane . The prodomain shares topological similarity with proteins ( KCNE1 , KCNE2 , KCNE4 ) known to trap potassium channels in the secretory pathway , suggesting a shared mechanism of channel regulation . MMP-23 's catalytic domain displays structural homology with catalytic domains in other metalloproteases , and likely functions as an endopeptidase . MMP-23 's ShK domain lies immediately after the catalytic domain and is connected to the IgCAM domain by a short proline-rich linker . It shares phylogenetic relatedness to sea anemone toxins and ICR-CRISP domains , being most similar to the BgK toxin from sea anemone " Bunodosoma granulifera . " This ShK domain blocks voltage-gated potassium channels ( K1.6 > K1.3 > K1.1 = K3.2 > K1.4 , in decreasing potency ) in the nanomolar to low micromolar range . K1.3 is required for sustaining calcium signaling during activation of human T cells . By trapping K1.3 in the endoplasmic reticulum via the prodomain , and by blocking the K1.3 channel with the ShK domain , MMP-23 may serve as an immune checkpoint to reduce excessive T cell activation during an immune response . In support , increased expression of MMP-23 in melanoma cancer cells decreases tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes , and is associated with cancer recurrence and shorter periods of progression-free survival . However , in melanomas , expression of MMP-23 does not correlate with K1.3 expression , suggesting that MMP-23 's deleterious effect in melanomas may not be connected with its K1.3 channel-modulating function . MMP-23 's C-terminal IgCAM domain shares sequence similarity with IgCAM domains in proteins known to mediate protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions ( e.g. CDON , human Brother of CDO , ROBO1-4 , hemicentin , NCAM1 and NCAM2 ) . In summary , the four domains of MMP-23 may work synergistically to modulate immune responses " in vivo . "

The Church and Monastery of Lipa is the location of a 1940s apparition of the Virgin Mary which was seen by sister Teresing Castillo and numerous accounts of rose petal showers from the 1940s to the 1960s . Some of the rose petals , which had the silhouette of the Virgin Mary when flashed with light , have been preserved by the Diocese of Lipa and various townfolks who have witnessed the petal showers . An investigation conducted by researchers of the University of the Philippines proved that the figures on the petals were natural and not stamped by man-made means . A few years after the apparition of the Virgin Mary , the Vatican released a document stating that the apparition in Lipa was false . Despite this , the rose petal showers continued until the last apparition of Mary appeared , saying three things , of which the most important was to ' pray for China ' , which at the time was among the poorest regions in the world . Due to the decline of the Vatican regarding the apparition , the Diocese of Lipa ordered the destruction of Mary 's statue in the church which depicted the apparition . However , the founding nuns of the church hid it instead . Decades afterwards in the 21st century , before the death of a founding nun , she wished for the statue of the apparition to be viewed by the public once more . Thousands of devotees went back to the church and since then , the statue has been in public view . During a certain event , the priest ordered a mass outside the church to bless the municipality of Lipa , where the apparition statue was brought outside as well . During that time , sun beatings from heaven , which was viewed by thousands of people during a mass outside the church , occurred . Devotees flocked Lipa afterwards , where cures for blindness and terminal sickness were cured through the usage of prayers with the preserved petals from the petal showers of the 1940s to the 1960s . In 2014 , it was later found out that most of the bishops who signed in favor of declaring the apparitions of the 1940s as a lie were forced to sign such documents . This sparked the current Lipa Church to gather as much evidence to back the existence and miracles of the apparitions .

Below Sapperton the Frome runs adjacent to the Thames and Severn Canal which is now disused , although undergoing restoration . This joins the Stroudwater Navigation ( Stroudwater Canal ) at Wallbridge . The Stroudwater Navigation is fed by the Slad Brook and the Painswick stream . Changes to water drainage to reduce flooding , carried out by the Severn River Board in 1957 and 1958 , resulted in the Randwick brook ( the Ozlebrook ) discharging into the canal route instead of passing under it by way of a siphon beneath Foundry Lock . The Stroudwater Navigation runs parallel to the Frome for most of its length westwards from Stroud , and was an important and essential part of Stroud 's growth as a town . At one time there was an access route for craft to enter the Frome in Dudbridge meadows , and to reach Kimmins Mill .

Zimmermann also declares that the compilers of the " Tathagātagarbha Sūtra " " did not hesitate to attribute an obviously substantialist notion to the buddha-nature of living beings , " and notes the total lack of evident interest in this sutra for any ideas of " emptiness " ( " śūnyatā " ) : " Throughout the whole " Tathagātagarbha Sūtra " the term " śūnyatā " does not even appear once , nor does the general drift of the " TGS " somehow imply the notion of śūnyatā as its hidden foundation . On the contrary , the sutra uses very positive and substantialist terms to describe the nature of living beings . ' Also , writing on the diverse understandings of Tathāgatagarbha doctrine , Jamie Hubbard comments on how some scholars see a tendency towards monism in the Tathāgatagarbha [ a tendency which Japanese scholar Matsumoto castigates as non-Buddhist ] . Hubbard comments :

In the Aghlabid government generally , the high positions were filled by " princes of the blood , whose loyalty could be relied on . " The judicial post of Qadi of Kairouan was said to be given " only to outstanding personalities notable for their conscientiousness even more than their knowledge . " On the other hand , the administrative staffs were composed of dependent clients ( mostly recent Arab and Persian immigrants ) , and the local bilingual " Afariq " ( mostly Berber , and which included many Christians ) . The Islamic state in Ifriqiya paralleled in many respects the government structure formed in Abbasid Baghdad . Aghlabid offices included the " vizier " [ prime minister ] , the " hajib " [ chamberlain ] , the " sahib al-barid " [ master of posts and intelligence ] , and numerous " kuttab " [ secretaries ] ( e.g. , of taxation , of the mint , of the army , of correspondence ) .

Because rule of law was perceived to be a mechanism of upper caste control , corruption used by caste mafia became popularly accepted , as it was perceived to be a means to achieve lower caste empowerment . The corruption elevated to such a level that nearly all elected officials in some towns and regions were also criminals . The upper castes who had used their control over the state to discreetly plunder its institutions for their own gain , were now replaced by the mafia dons who now openly pillaged the state institutions .

Introduced in December 1995 , CIBR2000 service was designed as a solution to a potentially devastating problem with wide-ranging ramifications . Many software programs written between the 1960s and 1990s used a two-digit date format to record calendar dates , thereby rendering a host of computer calculations inaccurate after 11 : 59 : 59 p.m. , December 31 , 1999 . Without the ability to recognize " 00 " as the beginning of the new century , computer programs that performed calculations related to inventory control , invoices , interest payments , pension payments , contract expirations , license and lease renewals , and myriad other tasks would generate false reports , create computer " bugs , " and perhaps cause systemwide shutdowns , all under the presumption that " 00 " signified the year 1900 . Ciber 's CIBR2000 division was created to solve the dilemma posed by the century date change and represented an area of substantial growth potential for the company during the latter half of the 1990s .

In June 1995 , WKLI / WABY ( 1400 ) owner Paul Bendat bought WEMX and that August ( after five weeks of syndicated talk shows and hot adult contemporary music ) changed the station 's format to a simulcast of the adult standards format heard on WABY . Initially , the station had various prior commitments on weekends to clear and was forced to sign off overnights due to a programming service conflict between WABY and WCKL in Catskill . In May 1996 , the station was granted a call letter change to WABY-FM .

In 2010 , the sector employed 58.2 % of the nations workforce , and contributed 15.7 % to the nations GDP . Cognisant of agriculture 's role in the economy , the 11th five-year economic plan that runs from 2007-2012 recognises the importance of proper soil management in agriculture . Soil degradation through excessive and miscalculated fertiliser use because of emphasis on increased output has led to nearly two-thirds of India 's farmlands to be classified as either degraded or sick . In attempts to increase knowledge on soils and soil management , the government of Gujarat initiated the Soil Health Cards Programme in 2006 that was " expected to bridge the gap between Scientists , agricultural extension workers , farmers and input-output dealers . " The programme relies on technology to disseminate accountable and uncomplicated scientific information that is based on the farmers needs . Farmers take samples of their soil for analysis in a state run laboratory . Based on the sample , farmers get information on the soil mineral and water content , fertiliser application methods , and advice on what crops to grow .

" To create the costumes , May spent one year in pre-production working with animators and her costume department of 20 people , while she contracted with five outside costume shops in Los Angeles and New York City . She became involved in the project during the time when the animators were designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to " translate the costumes from two-dimensional drawings to live-action human proportion . " Her goal was to keep the designs " Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new . " However , May admitted this was difficult " because they 're dealing with iconic Disney characters who have been in the psyche of the viewing audience for so long . "

Likewise , there were three main forms of government , each supported by a social " principle " : monarchies ( free governments headed by a hereditary figure , e.g. king , queen , emperor ) , which rely on the principle of honor ; republics ( free governments headed by popularly elected leaders ) , which rely on the principle of virtue ; and despotisms ( enslaved governments headed by dictators ) , which rely on fear . The free governments are dependent on fragile constitutional arrangements . Montesquieu devotes four chapters of " The Spirit of the Laws " to a discussion of England , a contemporary free government , where liberty was sustained by a balance of powers . Montesquieu worried that in France the intermediate powers ( i.e. , the nobility ) which moderated the power of the prince were being eroded . These ideas of the control of power were often used in the thinking of Maximilien Robespierre .

Other experts have called into question the quality of this phenomenological approach if it fails to educate Waldorf students on basic tenets of scientific fact . One study conducted by California State University at Sacramento researches outlined numerous theories and ideas prevalent throughout Waldorf curricula that were patently pseudoscientific and steeped in magical thinking . These included the idea that animals evolved from humans , that human spirits are physically incarnated into " soul qualities that manifested themselves into various animal forms , " that the current geological formations on Earth have evolved through so-called " Lemurian " and " Atlantiean " epochs , and that the four kingdoms of nature are " mineral , plant , animal , and man . " All of these are directly contradicted by mainstream scientific knowledge and have no basis in any form of conventional scientific study . Contradictory notions found in Waldorf textbooks are distinct from factual inaccuracies occasionally found in modern public school textbooks , as the inaccuracies in the latter are of a specific and minute nature that results from the progress of science . The former ( those inaccuracies present in Waldorf textbooks ) , however , are the result of a mode of thinking that has no valid basis in reason or logic . This unscientific foundation has been blamed for the scarcity of systematic empirical research on Waldorf education as academic researchers hesitate in getting involved in studies of Waldorf schools lest it hamper their future career .

The merchant had several lines of business : he bought and sold local produce in Portland and Boston , and operated a general store near his house . He also bought pre-cut fabric in Boston , which he pieced out to local women , who then assembled the fabric into men 's suits , shirts and trousers , which Leavitt sold back to clothiers in Boston , often at a healthy mark-up . The women were given credits at Leavitt 's store in return : the merchant 's extensive records for these transactions are today maintained at the Leavitt House .

Both the title of the song and the lyrical meaning are inspired by an encounter Love had with Kurt Cobain in 1991 prior to their relationship and marriage . Love had sent Cobain " a heart-shaped box scented with perfume and inside a porcelain doll , three dried roses , a miniature teacup and shellac-covered seashells " to apologize for their first meeting in May 1991 , where Love infamously wrestled with Cobain . The box , purchased in an antique store in New Orleans , was later the influence for the Cobain-penned Nirvana song , " Heart-Shaped Box . " The lyrics reflect Love 's initial feelings about Cobain having felt rejected by his lack of communication , which is most accurately conveyed in the line : " he only loves those things because he loves to see them break .

The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423 , where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer , may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release . The story of the execution of James III 's favourites , including the English musician William Roger , at Lauder Bridge in 1482 , may indicate his interest in music . Renaissance monarchs often used chapels to impress visiting dignitaries . James III also founded a new large hexagonal Chapel Royal at Restalrig near Holyrood , that was probably designed for a large number of choristers . In 1501 his son James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle , with a new and enlarged choir meant to emulate St. George 's Chapel at Windsor Castle and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music . Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII 's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503 . No piece of music can be unequivocally identified with these chapels , but the survival of a Mass based on the Burgundian song " L 'Homme armé " in the later " Carver Choirbook " may indicate that this was part of the Chapel Royal repertoire . James IV was said to be constantly accompanied by music , but very little surviving secular music can be unequivocally attributed to his court . An entry in the accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland indicates that when James IV was at Stirling on 17 April 1497 , there was a payment " to twa fithalaris [ fiddlers ] that sang Greysteil to the king , ixs . " " Greysteil " was an epic romance and the music survives , having been placed in a collection of lute airs in the seventeenth century .

Prior to filming the video , or releasing the single , Carey had toned her body , and lost a reported twenty pounds .

In addition , the league modified its shot clock rules , adopting a procedure similar to the NBA and Euroleague , featuring tenths of a second . The shot clock should also display the time remaining in the game . A portable shot clock that is capable of displaying tenths of a second and the time remaining in the game is temporarily installed if the in-venue shot clock is not capable to adopt the new shot clock rule or if the shot clock does not also display the game clock . The time the shot clock changes to tenths is determined by the venue and the brand of clock used . The Mall of Asia Arena uses the NBA and Euroleague rule ( final five seconds ) since its opening , as its Daktronics unit is the same model used by NBA ( most venues , 2011-16 ) and Euroleague venues ( Gran Canaria Arena ) . The Smart Araneta Coliseum 's clock registers tenths in the final ten seconds .

The rest of the chapter is devoted to discussing whether historians and archaeologists can talk of a " Pagan Middle Ages , " arguing that there was no such thing as a monolithic Christianity in Medieval Europe , but a variety of different religious positions across the continent . In this context , Milis argues , various " pagan rites , usages , ideas and ways of presenting things " were accepted into Christianity in different parts of Europe . He criticises the assumption of some earlier scholars that Christianity simply swept away the earlier pagan religions as it spread across Europe , highlighting the comparisons that could be made with the religious beliefs of indigenous peoples in Central and South America , or the black population of the Caribbean , all of which show a great deal of syncreticism between Christianity and older , traditional religion .

By the late 1960s ( with the introduction of the Caprice ) , the Bel Air and its Biscayne stablemate were primarily marketed to automotive fleet customers . However , the Bel Air remained available to retail customers who sought a basic , no-frills , full-sized car that was better trimmed than the low-line Biscayne . When the Biscayne was discontinued after 1972 , the Bel Air was demoted to the low-level model . Bel Airs again used two-segmented taillights as opposed to the triple-segmented lights of higher-level Impala and Caprice models , except in 1972 when all models shared the same triple-segmented lights mounted in the bumper .
While the aerospace industry is one of the primary users of gas tungsten arc welding , the process is used in a number of other areas . Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces , especially nonferrous metals . It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles , and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter , thin-wall tubing such as that used in the bicycle industry . In addition , GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes . In maintenance and repair work , the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies , especially components made of aluminum and magnesium . Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes , a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer . In fact , no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations . Filler metal alloys , such as elemental aluminum and chromium , can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization . This loss does not occur with the GTAW process . Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely , GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods , making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial .

Higher criticism , as it was called then , is the method of Biblical studies which seeks to demystify the texts of the Bible by reading them primarily as historical artifacts of human rather than divine origin . It examines the cultural and historic environment surrounding a text to find the author 's original intent apart from any external concerns added by later interpretations . By the end of the 19th century this method had become the de facto standard of Biblical interpretation throughout German speaking academia .

Corydoras kanei is a small species of catfish from the family Callyichthydae endemic to Brazil where it is found in the Negros River basin . It is externally similar to " Corydoras atropersonatus , " but its spots are denser and unlike the former , it has caudal markings - markings on its tail fins . Breeding can be accomplished by feeding a mixture of live foods and catfish pellets , after which frequent cold water changes can trigger them to spawn . A gravid female will lay around 60 eggs ; heavy oxygenation of the water is likely to be more efficacious at saving fry than using methylene blue . Fry grow slowly and reach around 2 cm after 8 months . It is not recommended to add different fish into the fry rearing tank . They do not mind lower temperatures and can be kept with species of fish that are endemic to low-temperature habitats , such as " Sewellia lineolata . "

The other means of public transport was the fiacre , a box-like coach drawn by one horse that could hold as many as four passengers , plus the driver , who rode on the exterior . In 1855 , the many different enterprises that operated fiacres were merged into a single company , the " Compagnie impériale des voitures de Paris . " In 1855 , the company had a fleet of 6,101 fiacres with the emblem of the company on the door , and the drivers wore uniforms . The fiacres carried lanterns that indicated the area in which their depot was located : blue for Belleville , Buttes-Chaumont , and Popincourt ; yellow for Rochechouart and the Pigalle ; green for the Left Bank ; red for Batignolles , Les Ternes and Passy . The color of the lantern allowed customers leaving the theaters to know which fiacres would take them to their own area . The fare was 1.80 francs for a journey , or 2.50 francs for an hour . A wait of more than five minutes allowed the driver to demand payment for a full hour . The drivers were paid 1.5 francs per day for a working day that could last 15 to 16 hours . The company maintained a special service of plain-clothes agents to keep an eye on the drivers and make certain they submitted all the money they had collected . The fiacre was enclosed and upholstered inside with dark blue cloth . Fiacres figured prominently in the novels and poetry of the period ; they were often used by clandestine lovers .

When the campaign of maneuver ended and the siege of Vicksburg began , an entirely new set of tactics came into play . Whereas there was little formal doctrine for battlefield tactics in the Civil War ( and none at all for operational maneuver ) , the sciences of fortification and siegecraft were well-established and understood by any military engineer trained at West Point . In keeping with the principles of fortification , the Confederates had erected strong earthwork fortifications that afforded interlocking fields of fire and commanded the approaches into Vicksburg . Trenches or " rifle pits " connected the major fortifications . After two failed assaults ( by far the bloodiest frontal attacks of the campaign ) , the Union forces responded with a siege that was also the product of conventional doctrine . Grant established two separate forces , one to face outward and block any Confederate interference from outside , and the other to enclose Vicksburg and " reduce " its fortifications . Union troops crept up to the Confederate positions through zigzag trenches called " saps " or " approaches " and dug mines under some of the major fortifications .

All proper scoring rules are equal to weighted sums ( integral with a non-negative weighting functional ) of the losses in a set of simple two-alternative decision problems that " use " the probabilistic prediction , each such decision problem having a particular combination of associated cost parameters for false positive and false negative decisions . A " strictly " proper scoring rule corresponds to having a nonzero weighting for all possible decision thresholds . Any given proper scoring rule is equal to the expected losses with respect to a particular probability distribution over the decision thresholds ; thus the choice of a scoring rule corresponds to an assumption about the probability distribution of decision problems for which the predicted probabilities will ultimately be employed , with for example the quadratic loss ( or Brier ) scoring rule corresponding to a uniform probability of the decision threshold being anywhere between zero and one . The accuracy score , which is zero or one depending on whether the predicted probability is on the appropriate side of 0.5 , is a proper scoring rule but not a strictly proper scoring rule .

" Hero " was well received by most music critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised Morris ' inventiveness and how she " skillfully slides between styles , blurring distinctions between genre and eras .

" Caramanica thought Morris an " astute synthesizer " of various styles , and found the album to be " both utterly of its moment and also savvy enough to indicate how the future might sound .

" " Sounds Like Nashville " referred to Morris ' songwriting talent , powerful vocals and eclectic music style that made " Hero " one of the most unique and enjoyable releases of 2016 .

Pearl S. Buck now weighed into the debate . In a review published in " The Christian Century , " she praised the report , saying it should be read by every Christian in America and , ironically mimicking the biblical literalism of the fundamentalists , " I think this is the only book I have ever read that seems to me literally true in its every observation and right in its every conclusion . " Then , in a November 1932 speech before a large audience at the Astor Hotel , later published in " Harper 's , " Buck decried gauging the success of missions by the numbers of new church members . Instead she advocated humanitarian efforts to improve the agricultural , educational , medical , and sanitary conditions of the community . She described the typical missionary as " narrow , uncharitable , unappreciative , ignorant . " In the " Harpers " article along with another in " Cosmopolitan " published in May 1933 , Buck rejected the doctrine of original sin , saying " I believe that most of us start out wanting to do right and to be good . " She asserted that belief in the virgin birth or the divinity of Christ was not a prerequisite to being a Christian . She said that the only need is to acknowledge that one can 't live without Christ and to reflect that in one 's life .

Cortinarius is a genus of mushrooms . It is suspected to be the largest genus of agarics , containing over 2000 different species and found worldwide . A common feature among all species in the genus " Cortinarius " is that young specimens have a cortina ( veil ) between the cap and the stem , hence the name , meaning " curtained . " Most of the fibers of the cortina are ephemeral and will leave no trace once gone , except for limited remnants on the stem or cap edge in some species . All have a rusty brown spore print . The common names cortinar and webcap refer to members of the genus . Due to dangerous toxicity of several species ( such as " Cortinarius orellanus " ) and the fact that it is difficult to distinguish between various species of the genus , non-expert consumption of mushrooms from the genus is discouraged .

Howell often fell foul of the club hierarchy who imposed strict codes of conduct on their players , and regularly appeared in front of the Football Committee on charges of ' misconduct ' although this often resulted in him being offered a pay increase and asked to ' mend his ways ' . More serious allegations were to be levelled at him however , as in his final season at the club he was believed to have attempted to throw a game against rivals for the Championship Sunderland , scoring two own goals . No charges were ever brought but Howell only played one more game for United before being quietly sold to Liverpool . He left Bramall Lane having played for 5 years , making over 200 appearances for the club . There is no evidence of match fixing , however . A more likely explanation for his sudden departure is his extra-marital affair : he set up another family in Lancashire after he left for Liverpool . Such a scandal in Victorian times would have been hushed up .

Most of the farmhouses are separated from one another by plots of cultivated land . A network of small roads some 2 to 4 metres in width connect these houses and date back to the Edo period . A more dominant , 6m-wide roadway runs north-south through the centre of the village , and is more recent , having been constructed in 1890 . Those houses built on steep ground near the base of the mountains are situated on small terraces , supported by stone walls . Property boundaries tend to be defined by the network of small roads , so the village has an open nature to it . Most land plots for either rice or grain production are very small , with larger plots of land found on the north and south side of the village . A Shinto shrine which houses the deity that guards the village is located on the south-central part of the village . There are also two Buddhist temples of the Jodo Shinsu sect .

Of a population of 40 million , around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation , and 12 million lacked clean water supplies , with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate .

Bubbles glides around in a gold Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III convertible - CB 1E , contrasting sharply with the working class life and the poverty of post-war Salford . From London along the newly constructed M1 , Bubbles heads to Manchester , a journey that is depicted as taking almost an age to complete . The scenes at the petrol station before they set off , and at the motorway service station with Yootha Joyce portrayed as an ostentatious millionairess and Alan Lake the RAF squaddie who cadges a lift and eventually drives the Rolls , tell a story of two tales . When they arrive in Manchester the reference to the colliery and the gas works further put forward the message that Bubbles has come a long way since he was a boy , but that even now after his success he isn 't really fulfilled . Liza Minnelli photographing the hatchet-faced old man at a bus stop and the child on a bike whilst driving open-top along the cobbled crumbling streets of cleared Victorian working-class terraced houses is particularly poignant .

Leibniz identified two kinds of truth , necessary and contingent truths . He believed necessary mathematical truths to be derived from the law of identity ( and the principle of non-contradiction ) : " Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through an analysis of terms , so that in the end they become identities , just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values [ for variables ] . That is , necessary truths depend upon the principle of contradiction . " Leibniz states that the sufficient reason for necessary truths is that their negation is a contradiction .

Along with DHA , vitamin E also supports the proper development of eyesight , reduces oxidative damage , and provides additional immune function support . During instances of immune system stimulation , such as vaccinations and infection , immune cells generate more tissue damaging free radicals . These free radicals are reduced by the action of antioxidants such as vitamin E , which promote the formation and maintenance of healthy immune cells . The adequate intake level laid out by the NRC consists of 24 mg / kg ( 36 IU / kg ) of vitamin E , with a recommended allowance of 30 mg / kg ( 45 IU / kg ) . However , the regulatory guidance laid out by AAFCO states a vitamin E minimum recommendation of 50 IU / kg DM . Nonetheless , these values have been shown to be insufficient for immune protection ; immune function is best optimized at a level of 500 IU / kg . In addition to prevention of free radical damage , this higher level of vitamin E greatly increases the number of memory CD4 + immune cells , aiding in a greater and a longer response to infection . Due to their still-developing immune system , puppies are more susceptible to infection than adult dogs , and proper levels of vitamin E , as indicated above , are needed in their diet .

Film editor Zach Staenberg states " what makes a movie is the editing . " It was not until the invention of editing that film and cinema was allowed to take off . Film is the product of editing , so it is not something that goes unnoticed . Editing has gone through different stages and has now reached a technique called post-classical editing . It is a style of editing characterized by shorter shot lengths , faster cuts between shots , and containing more jump shots and close-ups than classical editing characteristic of films prior to the 1960s .

The colliery formed a rugby union club in 1952 called Penallta RFC , and in 1954 produced 500,000 tonnes of coal . During 1960 the shafts were extended to reach 800 yards as part of a scheme , which also included electrification of the shaft winding engines .

Many differentials have no way of limiting the amount of engine power that gets sent to its attached output shafts . As a result , if a tire loses traction on acceleration , either because of a low-traction situation ( e.g. , driving on gravel or ice ) or the engine power overcomes available traction , the tire that is not slipping receives little or no power from the engine . In very low-traction situations , this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all . To overcome this , several designs of differentials can either limit the amount of slip ( these are called ' limited-slip ' differentials ) or temporarily lock the two output shafts together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally .

Reid and Brown in 1972 showed that there exists a doubly regular tournament of order " n " if and only if there exists a skew Hadamard matrix of order " n " + 1 . In a mathematical tournament of order " n , " each of " n " players plays one match against each of the other players , each match resulting in a win for one of the players and a loss for the other . A tournament is regular if each player wins the same number of matches . A regular tournament is doubly regular if the number of opponents beaten by both of two distinct players is the same for all pairs of distinct players . Since each of the " n " ( " n " − 1 ) / 2 matches played results in a win for one of the players , each player wins ( " n " − 1 ) / 2 matches ( and loses the same number ) . Since each of the ( " n " − 1 ) / 2 players defeated by a given player also loses to ( " n " − 3 ) / 2 other players , the number of player pairs ( " i , " " j " ) such that " j " loses both to " i " and to the given player is ( " n " − 1 ) ( " n " − 3 ) / 4 . The same result should be obtained if the pairs are counted differently : the given player and any of the ( " n " − 1 ) other players together defeat the same number of common opponents . This common number of defeated opponents must therefore be ( " n " − 3 ) / 4 . A skew Hadamard matrix is obtained by introducing an additional player who defeats all of the original players and then forming a matrix with rows and columns labeled by players according to the rule that row " i , " column " j " contains 1 if " i " = " j " or " i " defeats " j " and − 1 if " j " defeats " i . " This correspondence in reverse produces a doubly regular tournament from a skew Hadamard matrix , assuming the skew Hadamard matrix is normalized so that all elements of the first row equal 1 .

Family child care homes can be operated by a single individual out of their home . In most states , the legal age of 18 is only required . There may be occasions when more than one individual cares for children in a family childcare home . This can be a stay-at-home parent who seeks supplemental income while caring for their own child . There are also many family childcare providers who have chosen this field as a profession . Both state and county agency legislation regulate the ratios ( number and ages of children ) allowed per family child care home . Some counties have more stringent quality standards that require licensing for family child care homes while other counties require little or no regulations for childcare in individuals ' homes . Some family child care homes operate illegally with respect to tax legislation where the care provider does not report fees as income and the parent does not receive a receipt to qualify for childcare tax deductions . However , licensing a family child care home is beneficial for family child care home providers so that they can have access to financial benefits from their state government , or the federal government where they are allowed to accept children from parents who meet the criterion to benefit from the government childcare subsidy funding . Examples of such benefits are : free Professional Development and training courses , Child Care Food Program ( which allows eligible childcare and family childcare home providers to claim a portion of costs relating to nutritious meals served to children ) , and more ; .

The Apple II was unveiled to the public at the West Coast Computer Faire in April 1977 and became available for sale in June . One of the most common customer complaints about the computer was BASIC 's lack of floating-point capability . Integer BASIC is limited to whole numbers between − 32768 and 32767 and caused problems for users attempting to write business applications with it . Steve Wozniak had never added floating point capabilities to Integer BASIC as he did not consider them necessary for gaming and educational software , the two primary tasks he envisioned for the Apple II . As Wozniak - the only person who understood Integer BASIC well enough to add floating point features - was busy with the Disk II drive and controller and with Apple DOS , Apple turned to Microsoft . Making things more problematic was that the rival Commodore PET personal computer had a floating point-capable BASIC interpreter from the beginning . The Applesoft license also saved Microsoft from near-bankruptcy when they licensed BASIC to Commodore for the PET in an agreement that proved unexpectedly costly for them .

The Korean War saw the first widespread use of jet engine-powered fighter aircraft for both sides of a war . Subsequently , difficulty arose in crediting the number of victories for each side , thanks in part to poor records , intentional overestimation , and the difficulty of confirming crashes in MiG Alley , where the majority of air-to-air combat took place in the war . As a result , there is a large discrepancy on both sides as to the number of victories claimed versus aircraft lost , and it is extremely difficult to determine the accuracy of many victories . The ace status of dozens of pilots still remains in question .

Tobing Rony identifies three modalities in early ethnographic representation including " ethnographic inscription " ( Regnault ) , " taxidermic mode " ( Flaherty 's " Nanook " ) , and " self-reflexive " ( Rouch 's films of the 1950s ) . Of these , Rouch 's films are closest to being the forerunners of contemporary ethnocinema . Many film theorists and ethnohistorians have helped to define an evolving ethnographic film in the late 20th century , among them American Bill Nichols .
The human premature aging syndrome Hutchinson Gilford progeria is caused by a mutational defect in the processing of lamin A , a nuclear matrix protein . In a mouse model of this condition , recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage is delayed . The molecular mechanism underlying this delayed repair response involves a histone acetylation defect . Specifically , histone H4 is hypoacetylated at a lysine 16 residue ( H4K16 ) and this defect is due to reduced association of histone acetyltransferase , Mof , to the nuclear matrix

A number of countries have a national church which is not Established ( as the official religion of the nation ) , but is nonetheless recognised under civil law as being the country 's acknowledged religious denomination . Whilst these are not Christian states , the official Christian national church is likely to have certain residual state functions in relation to state occasions and ceremonial . Examples include Scotland ( Church of Scotland ) and Sweden ( Church of Sweden ) .

After several days of counting , the Division of Elections showed Murkowski with a lead of some 1,700 votes over Miller , with about 8,000 write-in votes yet to be counted , and a trend of counting 97 percent of the write-ins as for Murkowski . Murkowski 's campaign shied away from declaring a victory before the count was finished . As of November 17 , ( the last day of the hand count ) , the Division of Elections showed Murkowski having a lead of over 10,000 votes , meaning that even if all the 8,000 challenged ballots were discounted , Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes . The Miller campaign then demanded a hand recount of the entire election , claiming that as Murkowski 's votes were all verified by visual inspection Miller should get the same opportunity . The Division of Election officials responded that any recount of non-write-in votes would not be done by hand , but would be done using optical scanners .

VGA is referred to as an " Array " instead of an " adapter " because it was implemented from the start as a single chipan application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) which replaced both the Motorola 6845 video address generator and the dozens of discrete logic chips that covered the full-length ISA boards of the MDA and CGA . More directly , it replaced the five custom LSIs ( including a custom replacement for the 6845 ) and many discrete logic chips on the EGA board . Its single-chip implementation allowed the VGA to be placed directly on a PC ′ s motherboard with a minimum of difficulty , which in turn increased the reliability of the video subsystem by reducing the number of component connections , since the VGA required only video memory , timing crystals and an external RAMDAC . As a result , the first IBM PS / 2 models were equipped with VGA on the motherboard , in contrast to all of the " family one " IBM PC desktop modelsthe PC , PC / XT , and PC ATwhich required a display adapter installed in a slot in order to connect a monitor .

Most trafficked persons in Texas , whether domestic or international , come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds . Some internationally trafficked persons are lured by false promises of education and a better life in the United States . In other situations , what begins as a smuggling arrangement can turn into a case of human trafficking . In these schemes , smuggled persons are forced into coercive labor agreements upon arrival in order to pay off smuggling debts , and additional , " unforeseen " smuggling costs incurred during transportation are often added to the total . Many of these exploitative labor agreements deduct money for food and shelter , and smuggled persons are usually kept in the dark as to how much they still owe the smuggler . This has become increasingly more common as increased border security has pushed up the cost of smuggling into the U.S. International trafficking victims are controlled with threats of deportation , confiscation of identification and travel documents , and even threats of physical harm to other family members back at home . Other reasons for trafficked persons ' hesitation in reporting criminal activity to the authorities include their fear of incurring felony charges for their illegal immigration status , their distrust of the criminal justice system , language barriers , and an unawareness of their own victimization , which often occurs with trafficked minors .

The experience with King , despite only resulting in the completion of one track , " Bad Boyfriend , " gave the band perspective and direction . Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other , King could not get much work out of the band , so they realized that they needed to work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously . Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become " burned out on each other , " and that reuniting made them feel able to play " fast and furious - as if our lives depended on it . " Manson overcame her writer 's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics , matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions ; both " Metal Heart " and " Boys Wanna Fight " referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq . Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer , the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves . Erikson later said , " It was kind of seductive to think that maybe someone else [ would ] solve all of our problems , but in the end you gotta do it yourself . "

Mammalian carnivores are apparently readily hunted . Those recorded as prey have included sable ( " Martes zibellina " ) , American mink ( " Neovison vison " ) , Arctic fox ( " Vulpes lagopus " ) , red fox ( " Vulpes vulpes " ) , and small domestic dogs ( " Canis lupus domesticus " ) . Smaller mammals have also been recorded as prey , including northern red-backed vole ( " Clethrionomys rutilus " ) and tundra vole ( " Microtus oeconomus " ) . Carrion , especially that of mammals , is readily eaten during the winter . Around 35 % of eagles wintering in Japan move inland and feed largely on mammalian carcasses , predominantly sika deer ( " Cervus nippon " ) . In winter , immature Steller 's sea eagles may frequent slaughterhouses to pirate bits of offal . This eagle has been recorded preying occasionally on young seals . It was estimated in one study ( Brown & Amadon ) , that some seal pups carried off in flight by the eagles weighed at least 9.1 kg ( 20 lb ) , which ( if true ) would be the greatest load-carrying ever known for a bird ; however , the prey weights were not verified . Often seals and sea lion of any size are eaten as carrion and , using the huge bill , may be dismembered where found rather than flown with .

As director of the Anthropological division of the Geological Survey of Canada , Sapir embarked on a project to document the Indigenous cultures and languages of Canada . His first fieldwork took him to Vancouver Island to work on the Nootka language . Apart from Sapir the division had two other staff members , Marius Barbeau and Harlan I. Smith . Sapir insisted that the discipline of linguistics was of integral importance for ethnographic description , arguing that just as nobody would dream of discussing the history of the Catholic Church without knowing Latin or study German folksongs without knowing German , so it made little sense to approach the study of Indigenous folklore without knowledge of the indigenous languages . At this point the only Canadian first nation languages that were well known were Kwakiutl , described by Boas , Tshimshian and Haida . Sapir explicitly used the standard of documentation of European languages , to argue that the amassing knowledge of indigenous languages was of paramount importance . By introducing the high standards of Boasian anthropology , Sapir incited antagonism from those amateur ethnologists who felt that they had contributed important work . Unsatisfied with efforts by amateur and governmental anthropologists , Sapir worked to introduce an academic program of anthropology at one of the major universities , in order to professionalize the discipline .

The two-dimensional Fourier transform of an edge is also only non-zero on a single line , orthogonal to the edge . This function is sometimes referred to as the edge spread function ( ESF ) . However , the values on this line are inversely proportional to the distance from the origin . Although the measurement images obtained with this technique illuminate a large area of the camera , this mainly benefits the accuracy at low spatial frequencies . As with the line spread function , each measurement only determines a single axes of the optical transfer function , repeated measurements are thus necessary if the optical system cannot be assumed to be rotational symmetric .

The reasons for Khalid 's dismissal in 738 are obscure . Sources suggest that Hisham became jealous of Khalid 's wealth , but the real motive seems to have been Qaysi pressure to relieve him . Khalid certainly was taken by surprise by the arrival of his replacement , Yusuf ibn Umar . Yusuf immediately imprisoned Khalid and his sons , and tortured his predecessor to extract his wealth , a practice common during hand-overs of governorships at the time . After eighteen months , Khalid was released and went to Hisham 's capital Rusafa and then to his native Damascus . However , after Hisham died in early 743 , his successor al-Walid II ( ) sold Khalid back to Yusuf ibn Umar for 50 million " dirhams . " Yusuf again tortured him until Khalid died , an act which further exacerbated the Qays-Yaman feud and led to the downfall of al-Walid II .
Japan 's population is aging . During the 1950s , the percentage of the population in the 65-and-over group remained steady at around 5 % . Throughout subsequent decades , however , that age group expanded , and by 1989 it had grown to 11.6 % of the population . It was expected to reach 16.9 % by 2000 and almost 25.2 % by 2020 . Perhaps the most outstanding feature of this trend was the speed with which it was occurring in comparison to trends in other industrialized nations . In the United States , expansion of the 65-and-over age group from 7 % to 14 % took 75 years ; in the United Kingdom and Germany , this expansion took 45 years . The same expansion in Japan only took 24.5 years , passing 7 % in late 1970 and 14 % in early 1995 .

The Law established a Papuan People 's Assembly ( MRP ) with representatives of the different indigenous cultures of Papua . The MRP was empowered to protect the rights of Papuans , raise the status of women in Papua , and to ease religious tensions in Papua ; block grants were given for the implementation of the Law as much as $ 266 million in 2004 .

The CDO mechanism is still not well understood , despite active research to elucidate details of the reaction . Overall , the reaction involves addition of O to cysteine , which occurs spontaneously without enzyme catalysis . Studies have shown that the cysteinyltyrosine bridge lowers the oxidation potential of tyrosine ( commonly an electron donor , as in photosystem II ) by ~ 0.5 V relative to phenol and increases its acidity . The thioether moiety likely plays a structural , redox , or , acid / base role . Other studies have shown that Tyr157 is needed for enzyme function ( possibly as a tyrosinyl radical ) and is highly conserved across CDO variants . Furthermore , research has shown that cysteamine , a structurally similar molecule to cysteine , enhances cysteine oxidation but is not a substrate .

The walls a polymer usually interacts with are complex structures . Not only can the contour be full of bumps and twists , but their interaction with the polymer is far from the rigid mechanical idealization depicted above . In practice , a polymer will often be " absorbed " or condense on the wall due to attractive intermolecular forces . Due to heat , this process is counteracted by an entropy driven process , favoring polymer configurations that correspond to large volumes in phase space . A thermodynamic adsorption-desorption process arises . One common example for this are polymers confined within a cell membrane .
The seeds need to be covered with compost about 5mm deep and need to be in a cool , but well-lit space .

The Tevatron collided protons and antiprotons at a center-of-mass energy of about 2 TeV . The very high energy available for these collisions made it possible to produce heavy particles such as the Top quark and the W and Z bosons , which weigh much more than a proton ( or antiproton ) .

Lincoln Savings and Loan collapsed in 1989 , at a cost of $ 3.4 billion to the federal government ( and thus taxpayers ) . Some 23,000 Lincoln bondholders were defrauded and many investors lost their life savings . The substantial political contributions Keating had made to each of the senators , totaling $ 1.3 million , attracted considerable public and media attention . After a lengthy investigation , the Senate Ethics Committee determined in 1991 that Cranston , DeConcini , and Riegle had substantially and improperly interfered with the FHLBB 's investigation of Lincoln Savings , with Cranston receiving a formal reprimand . Senators Glenn and McCain were cleared of having acted improperly but were criticized for having exercised " poor judgment . "
Up until about twelve million years ago , this location was part of the seabed of the Pacific Ocean . In the Miocene era , precipitated by the combination of tectonic movement due to the seismically active environment and the presence of magma not far below the Earth 's surface , a massive period of uplift ensued . This uplift formed the volcanically based Mayacamas Mountains . Residual evidence of these ancient geological features appears in the form of scattered outcrops of basalt and rhyolite as well as local hot springs such as nearby Mortons Hot Springs and Agua Caliente Hot Springs . Some rock quarrying was historically conducted near Nunns Canyon Road in the upper Calabazas Creek watershed .

The " push " in the intercropping scheme is provided by the plants that emit chemicals ( kairomones ) which repel stemborer moths and drive them away from the main crop ( maize or sorghum ) . The best candidates discovered so far with the repellent properties are species of leguminous genus " Desmodium . " " Desmodium " is planted in between the rows of maize or sorghum . Being a low-growing plant , it does not interfere with the crops ' growth and , furthermore , has the advantage of maintaining soil stability , improving soil fertility through enhanced soil organic matter content and nitrogen fixation . It also serves as a highly nutritious animal feed and effectively suppresses striga weeds . Another plant showing good repellent properties is molasses grass ( " Melinis minutiflora " ) , a nutritious animal feed with tick-repelling and stemborer larval parasitoid attractive properties .

The desperation and the violent reaction of a generation robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977-1978 , whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s . These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant , relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing . They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads , often with safety pins and ripped clothes , and considered musical prowess unimportant as long as the music was simple and loud . However , not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement ; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal , which was equally effective in providing fun , stress relief , and peer companionship - otherwise denied because of their unemployment .

Several countries such as India and Sri Lanka , permit only their Islamic citizens to practice polygamy . Some Indians have converted to Islam in order to bypass such legal restrictions . Predominantly Christian nations usually do not allow polygamous unions , with a handful of exceptions being the Republic of the Congo , Uganda , and Zambia . Myanmar ( frequently referred to as Burma ) is also the only predominantly Buddhist nation to allow for civil polygynous marriages , though such is rarely tolerated by the Burmese population .
Sometimes a collector or institution will have a need to move objects outside of exhibit and storage locations . The collection management policy , which discusses the proper procedures for loans and acquisitions , must therefore also address proper packing and transport protocols to ensure that the objects arrive at their destination safely . To ensure safe transport , safe handling techniques must be combined with individual packing requirements for the specific object being shipped . Ideally , the object will be packaged in a shipping container that provides protection from shock , vibration , sudden climate changes , and mishandling . Collection management policies will advise staff on how best to address issues such as " the object 's fragility , the shipping method , the climate through which the objects will travel , and the climate at the object 's destination . " During the packing and transport process , it is likely that several departments within the shipping institution may contribute , and collaboration with the receiving institution must be arranged to provide policies for acclimatization and unpacking of the object once received .
The general rule was that non-EU citizens had to use a passport to enter EU member states . However , there was an exception to the Schengen Agreement rules for Croatian citizens . Based on the pre-Schengen bilateral agreements between Croatia and neighbouring EU countries ( Italy , Hungary and Slovenia ) , Croatian citizens were allowed to cross the border with only a Croatian national identity card ( a passport was not obligatory ) . Many people living near the border crossed it several times a day ( some work across the border , or own land on the other side of the border ) , especially on the border with Slovenia , which was unmarked for centuries as Croatia and Slovenia were both part of the Habsburg Empire ( 1527-1918 ) and Yugoslavia ( 1918-1991 ) . Prior to Croatia 's accession to the EU on 1 July 2013 , an interim solution , which received permission from the European Commission , was found : every Croatian citizen was allowed to cross the Schengen border into Hungary , Italy or Slovenia with an ID card and a special border card that was issued by Croatian police at border exit control . The police authorities of Hungary , Italy or Slovenia would then stamp the special border card both on entry and exit . Croatian citizens , however , were not allowed to enter any other Schengen Agreement countries without a valid passport , although they were allowed to travel between Hungary , Italy and Slovenia .

The best Ottoman painting was heavily concentrated in the capital , which from 1453 was Istanbul , and the most important patron was always the Sultan . The royal library remains very largely intact in Turkey , mostly at Topkapi Palace , and was greatly enriched by Persian manuscripts , initially taken during the several Ottoman invasions of eastern Persia , and later , after a treaty in 1555 , often received as diplomatic gifts . Many of these manuscripts were broken up to use the miniatures in albums . Persian artists were imported from virtually the start of the Ottoman tradition , but especially in the 16th century ; sixteen artists were brought back just from the brief Ottoman conquest of Tabriz in 1514 , though by 1558 the palace records list only nine foreign artists of all kinds , against twenty-six Turks . But a distinctively Ottoman style can be seen from the start of the 16th century , with pictures showing simpler landscape backgrounds , more sea and ships , neatly tented army camps , distant cityscapes , more individual characterization of faces , but also a less refined technique . There was strong European influence , mostly from Venice , but this was restricted to portraiture .

In power systems , harmonics are defined as positive integer multiples of the fundamental frequency . Thus , the third order harmonic is the third multiple of the fundamental frequency . This type of harmonics is generated in non-linear loads . Examples of nonlinear loads include transistors , electrical motors , and the non-ideal transformer . Non-linear loads create disturbances in the fundamental harmonic , which produce all types of harmonics . However , in this section we focus on the 3rd order harmonic due to its certain special characteristics in the context of powers systems .

Astrophysical sciences developed with attention to spectra of celestial sources to ascertain the chemical origin of these sources . The addition of radio astronomy extended the range of these spectra and revealed quasi-stellar sources with peculiar spectra . Maarten Schmidt and Jesse Greenstein found extreme red shifts in their studies , which demanded an explanation . Relativistic astrophysics offered its services as a generator of models such as black holes and their environs . Robinson , Schücking , and others organized the first Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics for December , 1963 , in Dallas . The Proceedings were published by University of Chicago Press as " Quasi-stellar Sources and Gravitational Collapse . " " It is now conventional wisdom that quasars are probably powered by rotating black holes , but it was here at Dallas that the black hole concept emerged as a serious astronomical hypothesis . "

Signals that sound too narrow - like too coherent stereo recordings monophonic recordings or synthetic sounds - can be widened by so-called pseudostereophony . These techniques have in common that they decorrelate the stereo channels by applying individual audio filters , reverberation and delay effects to each . This way the two channels ' signals are similar enough to be heard as one integrated stream , i.e. , one auditory sound object . At the same time the signals are so diverse that they do not seem to originate in a tiny point source but rather in a broad source .

The texts do not include the start or end year of Chandragupta 's reign . According to some Hindu and the Buddhist texts , Chandragupta 's ruled for 24 years . The Buddhist sources state Chandragupta Maurya ruled 162 years after the death of the Buddha .

Similarly , Jain sources composed nearly 1,200 years after Chandragupta 's death give different gap between Mahavira 's death and his accession . As with Buddha 's death , the date of Mahavira 's death itself is also a matter of debate , and the inconsistencies and lack of unanimity among the Jain authors casts doubt on Jain sources . This Digambara Jain chronology , in addition , is not reconcilable with the chronology implied in other Indian and non-Indian sources .

Budget cuts and the interruption of World War II repeatedly postponed the Fort Circle Park plan , but it was the growth of the city of Washington itself that eventually killed the plan . By 1963 , when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress to finally build the Fort Circle Drive , many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly questioning whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness . After all , by this time , Washington had grown past the ring of forts that had protected it a century earlier , and city surface roads already connected the parks , albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned .

Han farmers in the Yangzi River region of southern China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice . Every year , they would burn the weeds in the paddy field , drench it in water , sow rice by hand , and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time . In this system , the field lays fallow for much of the year and thus did not remain very fertile . However , Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation . In this system , individual plants were given intensive care ( perhaps in the same location as the paddy field ) , their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved , and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery .

The stream flows through an area of the Klamath Mountains created by uplift caused by the collision of multiple exotic terranes ( in this case , a fragment of uplifted crust formed by tectonic activity on the Pacific Plate ) with the North American plate . The resulting buckling stress caused the formation of the mountain ranges of northwestern California in stages . Hayfork Creek runs across the western part of the Hayfork Terrane , which was formed about 165 million years ago by plutonic activity beneath the Pacific Plate , and collided with the North American Plate sometime between 140 and 120 million years ago . By the mid-Paleocene , approximately 59 million years ago , the Klamath Mountains first rose ; erosion and orogeny occurred over time continuing to this day , with the last great mountain-building period in the Pleistocene , about 1.6 million years ago . It is believed that the present course of the stream had been established prior to the formation of the mountains - as they rose , the creek 's erosional force cut canyons and valleys into the bedrock , maintaining its course .

Over 100 years after the formation of its national association , Wales finally became a football nation with its own national league .

At Stanton 's direction , employees were required to take an oath of loyalty to the US government .

Marx 's view of history , which came to be called historical materialism ( controversially adapted as the philosophy of dialectical materialism by Engels and Lenin ) , certainly shows the influence of Hegel 's claim that one should view reality ( and history ) dialectically . However , Hegel had thought in idealist terms , putting ideas in the forefront , whereas Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in materialist terms , arguing for the primacy of matter over idea . Where Hegel saw the " spirit " as driving history , Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification , obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world . He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head , and that one needed to set it upon its feet . Despite his dislike of mystical terms , Marx used Gothic language in several of his works : in " The Communist Manifesto " he proclaims " A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of communism . All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre , " and in " The Capital " he refers to capital as " necromancy that surrounds the products of labour . "

An advantage of the dynatron circuit was that it could oscillate over a very wide frequency range ; from a few hertz to 20 MHz . It also had very good frequency stability compared to other LC oscillators of that time , and was even compared to crystal oscillators .

It was used in beat frequency oscillators ( BFOs ) for code reception and local oscillators in superheterodyne receivers as well as in laboratory signal generators and scientific research . RCA 's 1931 prototype television used two UY224 tubes as dynatron oscillators to generate the vertical deflection ( 28 Hz ) and horizontal deflection ( 2880 Hz ) signals for the CRT 's deflection coils .

A utilitarian argument against torture is that the majority of tortures are employed not as a method of extracting information , but as a method of terrorizing and subjugating the population , enabling state forces to dispense with ordinary means of establishing innocence or guilt and with the whole legal apparatus altogether . Therefore , it is better that a few individuals be killed by bombers than a much greater number - possibly thousands of innocent people - be tortured and murdered and legal and constitutional provisions destroyed . During the investigation of Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro 's kidnapping , General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa reportedly responded to a member of the security services who suggested torture against a suspect , " Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro . It would not survive the introduction of torture . "

The etymology of the word " Zion " is uncertain . Mentioned in the Bible in the Book of Samuel ( 2 Samuel 5 : 7 ) as the name of the Jebusite fortress conquered by King David , its origin likely predates the Israelites . If Semitic , it may be associated with the Hebrew root " " ṣiyyôn " ( " castle " ) . Though not spoken in Jerusalem until hundreds of years later , the name is similar in Arabic and may be connected to the root " ṣiyya " ( " dry land " ) or the Arabic " šanā " ( " protect " or " citadel " ) . It might also be related to the Arabic root " ṣahî " ( " ascend to the top " ) or " ṣuhhay " ( " tower " or " the top of the mountain " ) . A non-Semitic relationship to the Hurrian word " šeya " ( " river " or " brook " ) has also been suggested .

The cost efficiency of Sorghum tends to depend on the environment . Sorghum can be a significant crop for animal feed , which is important for those living in Nepal with animals . All parts of the plant , both the grain and stem can be sold and used . A huge advantage of sorghum to subsistence farmers in places in Africa and Asia , specifically in Nepal is that Sorghum is actually one of the few crops that will be able to adapt to future climate change as it contains many resilient qualities . In addition , the cost of production in Asia has been said to have decreased ( per ton ) between the 1980s and 1990s compared to the cost in the 1970s . The cost and return ratio from improved varieties in Asia is around a 1 : 1.4 ratio . This is a good ratio for subsistence farmers .

In September 2004 , shortly after the release of OpenNTPD 3.6 , ISC NTP contributor Brad Knowles published an article entitled " OpenNTPd Considered Harmful " criticizing various aspects of OpenNTPD 's implementation of the NTP protocol , as well as the split development model that the project employs , which is also used in the development of OpenSSH and OpenBGPD . In December 2004 , Darren Tucker , the principal developer on the portable branch of OpenNTPD , wrote a detailed response to Knowles , acknowledging some issues as valid , rejecting several others as unwarranted , and considering yet others as misleading . Among the more serious issues raised by Knowles was that OpenNTPD servers claimed to be stratum 1 servers . The issue had however already been fixed by the time of Tucker 's response . In March 2005 , Knowles acknowledged Tucker 's response , and stated that he was " going to do everything [ he could ] to work with [ Tucker ] to get any remaining issues resolved . " Additionally , the OpenBSD networking FAQ was expanded with a response to Knowles ' initial criticism .

Collecting and hoarding may seem similar , but there are distinct characteristics between hoarders and collectors that set them apart . Collecting often involves the targeted search and acquisition of specific items that form - at least from the perspective of the collector - a greater appreciation , deeper understanding , or increased synergistic value when combined with other similar items . Hoarding , by contrast , appears haphazard and involves the overall acquiring of common items that should not be especially meaningful to the person who is gathering such items in large quantities . People who hoard commonly keep items that hold little to no true meaning or value to most others , unlike some collectors , whose items may be of great value to select people . Most hoarders are disorganized , and their living areas are crowded and in disarray . Most collectors can afford to store their items systematically or have enough room to put their collections on display . There have been on occasion collectors who because of their age , mental state , or finances have had their collections fall into a hoarding state .

More recently , some games have begun offering multiple endings to increase the dramatic effect of moral choices within the game , although early examples also exist . Still , some games have gone beyond small choices or special endings , offering a branching storyline , known as an interactive narrative , that players may control at critical points in the game . Sometimes the player is given a choice of which branch of the plot to follow , while sometimes the path will be based on the player 's success or failure at a specific challenge . For example , Black Isle Studios ' " Fallout " series of role-playing video games features numerous quests where player actions dictate the outcome of the story behind the objectives . Players can eliminate in-game characters permanently from the virtual world should they choose to do so , and by doing so may actually alter the number and type of quests that become available to them as the game progresses . The effects of such decisions may not be immediate . Branches of the story may merge or split at different points in the game , but seldom allow backtracking . Some games even allow for different starting points , and one way this is done is through a character selection screen .

Zhu Ju 's army was to receive a salary of 30,000 strings of coins , but the coppersmith Wang Sui ( 王遂 ) secretly took some of the coins for himself . Zhu Ju 's army was paid less than expected . Lü Yi , the supervisor of the audit bureau , suspected Zhu Ju of embezzling military funds , so he had the finance officer in Zhu 's army arrested and interrogated . The officer died under torture during the interrogation . Zhu Ju felt that the officer died a wrongful death so he had the officer properly buried . Lü Yi wrote to Sun Quan and claimed that Zhu Ju conspired with the finance officer to embezzle military funds and the fact that Zhu had the officer properly buried served as evidence of the conspiracy . When Zhu Ju was repeatedly summoned to meet Sun Quan for questioning , he was unable to explain himself so he laid down on a straw mat to await his fate . Some months later , another inspector Liu Zhu ( 劉助 ) discovered the truth and reported that the coppersmith Wang Sui was actually the culprit , thereby clearing Zhu Ju 's name . Sun Quan was very moved when he learnt the truth and he said , " Even Zhu Ju fell victim to injustice , much less other officials and the people . " He then punished Lü Yi and rewarded Liu Zhu with a million coins .

Perth-based architect Anna Meszaros was responsible for the interior design of the centre during the 1996 redevelopment . In an interview with " Inside Retailing " magazine , she noted how she wanted to move away from the " " Disneyland effect of bright colours " . " Her brief was to provide customers to the centre a point of difference , particularly in the food court area . Like most conventional food courts , stores were arranged around a quadrangle , however unlike other food courts of the time the use of outside space was incorporated into the design . This was done by providing direct sunlight and outdoor connection by using curved skylights following the quadrangle shape . This was later upgraded to include an alfresco dining area . The area in the middle of the food court was raised using a timber floor with removable dining furniture , providing for significant flexibility in how it is used .

On 12 September 2012 , the world-renowned hacker group Anonymous made a statement in a video online indicating their opposition to the Clean IT project . They highlight the ambiguity of the notion of " cyber terrorism " and the possibility that the government will twist the definition of this term in order to censor internet usage at home . The Anonymous also argue that this Clean IT project will violate the two main principles of the online environment which are Internet anonymity and Internet neutrality . The group argues that if this project goes under way , everyone on the internet will be required to reveal their names and personal privacy will be void .

The anonymous message ends with a threat to the European government by saying that the group is willing to break down any kinds of rules and restrictions in order to put a stop to the project .

The Reform of 1906 was a giant leap towards the political and social liberalisation of the common Finnish people because the Russian House of Romanov had been the most autocratic and conservative ruler in Europe . The Finns adopted a unicameral parliamentary system , the Parliament of Finland ( ; ) with universal suffrage . The number of voters increased from 126,000 to 1,273,000 , including female citizens . The reform led to the social democrats obtaining about fifty percent of the popular vote , but the Czar regained his authority after the crisis of 1905 . Subsequently , during the more severe programme of Russification , called " the Second Period of Oppression " by the Finns , the Czar neutralised the power of the Finnish Parliament between 1908 and 1917 . He dissolved the assembly , ordered parliamentary elections almost annually , and determined the composition of the Finnish Senate , which did not correlate with the Parliament .

If one is to allow for approximations to be made , a simpler way ( without necessarily assuming the fluid is incompressible ) to obtain an approximation to Lighthill 's equation is to assume that formula _ 30 , where formula _ 31 and formula _ 32 are the ( characteristic ) density and pressure of the fluid in its equilibrium state . Then , upon substitution the assumed relation between pressure and density into formula _ 33 we obtain the equation ( for an inviscid fluid , σ = 0 )

In cofactor engineering , a metabolic pathway is altered by changing the concentrations of specific cofactors that are produced either in that particular pathway or in a separate pathway . For example , an hypothetical organism could have two arbitrary pathways called A and B where some enzymes in both A and B utilize the same cofactors . If scientists wanted to decrease the output of pathway A , they may first consider directly engineering the enzymes involved in A , perhaps to decrease a particular active site 's affinity for its substrate . In some cases however , the enzymes in A may be difficult to engineer for various reasons , or it may be impossible to engineer them without dangerously affecting some third metabolic pathway C , which utilizes the same enzymes . As a separate option , scientists could increase the flux of B , which may be easier to engineer . This in turn could " tie up " the cofactors needed by A , which would slow enzymatic activity , decreasing output in A. This is one hypothetical example of how cofactor engineering can be used , but there are many other unique cases where scientists use cofactors as a way of altering metabolic pathways . A major advantage to cofactor engineering is that scientists can use it to successfully alter metabolic pathways that are difficult to engineer by means of ordinary metabolic engineering . This is achieved by targeting more easily engineered enzymes in separate pathways , which use the same cofactors . Since many cofactors are used by different enzymes in multiple pathways , cofactor engineering may be an efficient , cost effective alternative to current methods of metabolic engineering .

Arranging another chess problem in the same room where the nerve gas has been stockpiled , the Doctor is able to delay Fenric , while he runs off to seek a more permanent solution . Sorin , the last remaining member of his squad , enters the room and prepares to shoot Fenric , but Fenric reveals that Sorin is one of his " wolves , " having descended from the Vikings that carried the cursed vase to the English shores and takes over his body . When Ace returns to the room , she unwittingly helps Fenric , in Sorin 's body , to solve the chess problem . The Doctor arrives too late , as Fenric can no longer be stopped . Fenric orders the Ancient One to attack the Doctor but a psychic barrier created by Ace 's trust in the Doctor prevents the Ancient One from acting . The Doctor is forced to reveal to Ace that she too is one of Fenric 's pawns , as it was he that created the time storm that transported her to the alien colony Iceworld . Furthermore , by saving Kathleen and Audrey , she has assured that the cycle remain unbroken , as Audrey will grow up to become Ace 's mother whom she despises . Ace 's faith is shattered , causing the psychic barrier to drop but , instead of attacking the Doctor , the Ancient One grabs Fenric , pulls him into a sealed chamber and releases a lethal dose of the gas . The chamber explodes , killing them both . As the Doctor and Ace recover along the shore , Ace takes a moment to contemplate why she hates her mother and to celebrate overcoming her irrational fear of the water , before she and the Doctor return to the TARDIS .

Most bacteria do not live in environments that contain large amounts of nutrients at all times . To accommodate these transient levels of nutrients bacteria contain several different methods of nutrient storage in times of plenty for use in times of want . For example , many bacteria store excess carbon in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoates or glycogen . Some microbes store soluble nutrients such as nitrate in vacuoles . Sulfur is most often stored as elemental ( S ) granules which can be deposited either intra- or extracellularly . Sulfur granules are especially common in bacteria that use hydrogen sulfide as an electron source . Most of the above-mentioned examples can be viewed using a microscope and are surrounded by a thin nonunit membrane to separate them from the cytoplasm .

Faulty development of odor discrimination impairs the perception of pheromones and pheromone-related behavior , like aggressive behavior and mating in male rats : The enzyme Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 ( MAPK7 ) has been implicated in regulating the development of the olfactory bulb and odor discrimination and it is highly expressed in developing rat brains , but absent in most regions of adult rat brains . Conditional deletion of the MAPK7gene in mouse neural stem cells impairs several pheromone-mediated behaviors , including aggression and mating in male mice . These behavior impairments were not caused by a reduction in the level of testosterone , by physical immobility , by heightened fear or anxiety or by depression . Using mouse urine as a natural pheromone-containing solution , it has been shown that the impairment was associated with defective detection of related pheromones , and with changes in their inborn preference for pheromones related to sexual and reproductive activities .

Even though Prinz 's subsequent career in the United States was intimately involved with the Civil Rights Movement , the March on Washington , and other anti-fascist and anti-racist campaigns , there is no doubt that Prinz , like many of the volkish German Zionists , approved of the Nazis ' opposition to Jewish ' assimilation ' .

He is considerably more good-natured than Ralph , but nonetheless trades insults with him on a regular basis . Ed ( typically called " Norton " by Ralph and sometimes by his own wife , Trixie ) often gets mixed up in Ralph 's schemes . His carefree and rather dimwitted nature usually results in raising Ralph 's ire , while Ralph often showers him with verbal abuse and throws him out of the apartment when Ed irritates him . In most episodes , Ed is shown to be better-read , better-liked , more worldly and more even-tempered than Ralph , despite his unassuming manner and the fact that he usually lets Ralph take the lead in their escapades . Ed and Ralph both are members of the fictional Raccoon Lodge . ( " An Emergency Meeting is an emergency meeting - never a poker game . An Executive Meeting , " that 's " a poker game . " ) According to " Entertainment Weekly , " Norton is one of the " greatest sidekicks . " Ed worked for the New York City sewer department and described his job as a " Sub-supervisor in the sub-division of the department of subterranean sanitation , I just keep things moving along .

Usage of Black Friday Advertising Tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the U.S. , influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax . However , in recent years , the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S. , especially from Canada . Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002 .

" Just as all Christianity is purely devotional love after Christ 's example , the entire Bible is purely a human creation . Yes , a creation inspired by the personal faith of the prophets and apostles ; brought forth by the national genius of the Hebrews , which genius both the apostles and the prophets represented ; one that did not fall from the clouds like a meteor , but rose from the bosom of the Jewish people , as the goddess of beauty rose from the billows whose foam created her ; one which was not , in part or whole , put on paper and collected in one or two volumes through the external intervention of Providence , but which emerged leaf by leaf , like a budding flower , from the stem of Israel ; one that did not bypass the Jews or go over the heads as it came to us from God , but came from the Jews themselves , under God 's guidance ; a human creation , in other words , inspired by human faith , consummated by human art , preserved by human care , understood by every true human heart and acknowledged as the voice of the heart , as the voice of human devotion , human suffering , human happiness : such is the human creation the Bible is to me .

The initial plan from 1995 involved two intermediate stations , at Vevelstad and Kolbotn . The plans also suggested building the line in two phases , first between Ski and Kolbotn , and then from Kolbotn to Oslo . In 2008 , the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way - both predominantly in tunnel . The one proposal included Kolbotn , the other did not . Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line , since the station could not develop as a hub , and would still keep services along the existing commuter line . A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008 , and ordered by the Rail Administration , concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction . A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion , while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion . The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north . The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub . In 2009 , the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn , stating that it was more important to secure a fast connection to Ski . At the same time , they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn .

When the project finished Norsk Data was without orders . Sales representatives were not appreciated in the company and were typically fired about once a year . The company 's strategy was to create excellent products which could sell themselves . As the twenty-five people involved in the Nordic project were not required elsewhere , they were moved to the marketing department . It was first with this move that the company 's management started realizing the importance of marketing . However , other non-technical departments , especially finances , had also not been keeping up with the company 's growth . Kolbjørn Johansen was therefore hired as chief financial officer in 1969 . The board decided on 18 October 1972 to replace Monrad-Krohn with Johansen as CEO , with the former becoming chair of the board . He would within a few years leave Norsk Data and establish Mycron and Tiki Data .

However , as the Earth gravity assist approached , astronomers were unable to locate Comet Boethin , which is too faint to be observed . Consequently , its orbit could not be calculated with sufficient precision to permit a flyby . Instead , the team decided to send " Deep Impact " to comet 103P / Hartley requiring an extra two years . NASA approved the additional funding required and retargeted the spacecraft . Mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory began redirecting EPOXI on November 1 , 2007 . They commanded the spacecraft to perform a three-minute rocket burn that changed the spacecraft 's velocity .

The committee , which Curtis chaired from 1912 to 1936 , was formed by community business interests to take advantage of the park 's tourism potential . Curtis , through the committee , sought to promote greater accessibility to the park by building roads to increase tourism . His opposition to the expansion of the Olympic National Park in the late 1930s as a representative of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce and the timber industry , led to a further deterioration of relations with the Mountaineers . It also caused a rift between Curtis and his fellow Mt . Rainier boosters and effectively ended his involvement in park affairs .

The pharyngeal jaws of teleosts , a second set of jaws contained within the throat , are composed of five branchial arches , loops of bone which support the gills . The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials , ceratobranchials , epibranchials and pharyngobranchials . The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate . The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials , and sometimes additionally , some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial . The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second , third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper . In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium , pectoral girdle , and hyoid bar . Their function is limited to merely transporting food , and they rely mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity . In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful , with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw ; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium . They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it .

With the establishment of St Peter 's College on the adjoining site in 1994 , the opportunity arose to embark on an innovative venture which has since become a model for school / community ventures elsewhere in Ireland . The money that would have been spent on putting sports facilities into the College , £ 280,000 , was instead invested in the Centre . Through further fund-raising , the Committee added another £ 150,000 to this and the result was a major extension of the building in 1997 . This arrangement provided the College with a larger sports hall than it otherwise would have had while , outside of school hours , the extension enabled the centre to cater better for the growing community . A Health & Fitness Club was added in January 2000 , and a floodlit all-weather pitch ( another joint venture with St Peter 's College ) in 2004 . St Peters College is located at the back of the Dunboyne Community Centre .

where VSWR is the standing wave ratio expressed as a voltage ratio ( not in decibels ) . However , to completely characterise the reflection coefficient , the phase of ρ must also be found . This is done on a slotted line by measuring the distance of the first minimum from the DUT . Moving the probe right up to the DUT is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted . The position of the first minimum when the reference short is in place is noted . The distance back along the line from this reference point to the next minimum when the DUT is in place will be the same as the distance from the DUT to the first minimum . This is so because the reference short guarantees a minimum at the DUT position .

In three phase electrical power distribution , conductors must be designed to have low electrical impedance in order to assure that the power lost in the distribution of power is minimal . Impedance is a combination of two quantities : resistance and reactance . The resistances of ASCR conductors are tabulated for different conductor designs by the manufacturer at DC and AC frequency assuming specific operating temperatures . The reasons that resistance changes with frequency are largely due to the skin effect , the proximity effect , and hysteresis loss . Depending on the geometry of the conductor as differentiated by the conductor name , these phenomena have varying degrees of affecting the overall resistance in the conductor at AC vs DC frequency .

The restriction of the divisibility relation to the set of all monic polynomials ( over the given ring ) is a partial order , and thus makes this set to a poset . The reason is that if " p " ( " x " ) divides " q " ( " x " ) and " q " ( " x " ) divides " p " ( " x " ) for two monic polynomials " p " and " q , " then " p " and " q " must be equal . The corresponding property is not true for polynomials in general , if the ring contains invertible elements other than 1 .

Although the Dirty War ended in the eighties , Kirchner considered it an unresolved issue . In his inaugural speech , he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process . He also ordered the top military leadership to retire . Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law of Due Obedience , which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War . The laws had been repealed in 1998 , but that repeal had little legal significance , as only an annulment would reopen the cases . Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli , most legislators considered it a symbolic gesture since the laws ' constitutionality would be decided by the Supreme Court . Both laws were annulled by the Congress in August 2003 , and many cases were reopened as a result .

A hit single is variously called a " number one hit , " a " top 10 hit , " a " top 20 hit " or a " top 40 hit , " depending on its peak position . In the UK ( where radio play is not included in the official charts ) , this doesn 't completely reflect the song 's popularity - as the weekly chart position is based solely on direct comparison with concurrent sales of other singles . It is , therefore , not uncommon that a single fails to chart , but has actually sold more copies than other singles regarded as " hits " based on their higher chart placement in a period of low sales . ( This is also possible in the United States , or anywhere , with slow but steady sellers ; a number of minor hits , especially those that are popular in specific genre , have earned gold certifications despite relatively poor pop chart performances . )

WHAS-TV lost ABC programming when WLKY ( channel 32 ) signed on September 16 , 1961 , with channel 11 becoming an exclusive CBS affiliate . Nearly three decades later on September 8 , 1990 , channel 11 ended its long relationship with CBS and rejoined ABC , this time as an exclusive affiliate of the network . At the time of the switch , ABC was the second-most-watched network in the country ( after NBC ) , and the network was concerned with WLKY 's ratings ; CBS was at a distant third during the midway-point of president Laurence Tisch 's helming of the network . WLKY , which became the market 's CBS affiliate , has since made strong strides in the market as cable penetration allowed WLKY 's traditional disadvantage of being on the UHF band to fade , and other factors allowed the station to strengthen its news operation and adequately compete with WHAS-TV 's newscasts . In addition , WLKY became the local home for the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Tournament , and owing to the region 's status as a college basketball hotbed with local teams such as Kentucky , Louisville and Indiana being longtime fixtures in the tournament , NCAA tournament games on WLKY are consistently among the highest-rated programs in the market during the tournament 's run . Channel 11 has seen some struggles over the years during television seasons when ABC suffers from a weaker-rated schedule , while WLKY 's ties to CBS have boosted that station through most of the 2000s .

Discounting Antarctica and its ice sheets , only one other continent ( Asia ) borders three oceans , but the inward-draining endorheic basin area of Central Asia from western China to the Aral and Caspian Seas is so vast that any Arctic and Indian Ocean tributaries are never within proximity of each other . Thus , North America 's status of having a single location draining into three oceans is unique in the world .
When Parikshit raised his sword to kill Kali , the sudra stripped himself of his royal garments and prostrated himself at the emperor 's feet . The emperor knew Kali tainted the world with his evil and so had no place in it and raised his sword once more . But Kali interceded again and begged the emperor to spare his life and allow him a place to live within his empire . Parikshit decided that Kali would live in " gambling houses , in taverns , in women and men of unchaste lives , in slaughtering places and in gold . " And as long as Parikshit ruled India , Kali stayed within the confines of these five places . This act allowed Dharma to regain his legs and the earth to be relieved of much burden . However , Parikshit was later cursed to die by snake bite after hunting in the forest and throwing a dead snake on an unresponsive sage practicing austerities . Upon the emperor 's death , " Kali made his way to other places like wild fire and established his power throughout the length and breadth of the whole world . "

Harper 's Songs are ancient Egyptian texts that originated in tomb inscriptions of the Middle Kingdom ( but found on papyrus texts until the Papyrus Harris 500 of the New Kingdom ) which in the main praise life after death and were often used in funerary contexts . These songs display varying degrees of hope in an afterlife that range from the skeptical through to the more traditional expressions of confidence . These texts are accompanied by drawings of blind harpists and are therefore thought to have been sung . Thematically they have been compared with The Immortality of Writers in their expression of rational skepticism .

The towns of the Frentani mentioned by ancient writers are few in number ; but the topography of the district has been thrown into great confusion by the perverted zeal of certain local antiquarians , and by the reliance placed on inscriptions published by some early writers , which there is great reason to regard as forgeries . The " Antichità Frentane " ( 2 vols . 8vo . , Naples , 1809 ) of the Abbate Romanelli , who was a native of this part of Italy , is a very uncritical performance ; but the author was led astray principally by the inscriptions and other documents put forth by Polidoro , an Italian antiquary of the 18th century , who appears to have had no hesitation in forging , or at least corrupting and altering them in such a manner as to suit his purpose . Romanelli , in his later and more extensive work , simply abridged the results of his former book ; and Cramer , as usual , blindly follows Romanelli . Along the sea-coast ( proceeding from north to south ) were situated " Ortona , " " Histonium , " and " Buca . " The two former may be clearly fixed , Ortona retaining its ancient name , and the ruins of " Histonium " being still extant at Vasto , but there is considerable difficulty in determining the site of " Buca , " which may however be fixed with much probability at Termoli ; the arguments that have led many writers to place it near Villa Santa Maria being based principally upon the spurious inscriptions just alluded to . The existence of a town called " Interamna , " supposed by Romanelli and Cramer to have occupied the site of Termoli , is derived only from the same apocryphal source ; and , even were the inscription itself authentic , the " Interamna " there meant is probably the well-known town of the Praetutii . The only inland town of importance among the Frentani was " Anxanum " ( Lanciano ) ; but , besides this , Pliny mentions , in the interior of the country , the " Carentini supernates et infernates , " and the " Lanuenses " ; the former ( apparently a corruption of " Caretini " or Carricini ) and the latter are otherwise unknown , and the site of their towns cannot be fixed with any approach to certainty . On the other hand , the Tabula gives the name of a place called " Pallanum " of which no other mention occurs , but the site of which , according to Romanelli , is marked by extensive ruins at a place called Monte Pallano , about 5 km southwest of Atessa . The previous station given by the same authority is called " Annum " ; a name probably corrupt , but the true reading for which is unknown . " Uscosium , " a place given in the " Itinerary of Antoninus , " which reckons it 15 miles from Histonium , on the road into Apulia , is fixed by this distance at a spot near the right bank of the little river Sinarca , about 9 km southwest of Termoli , but in the territory of Guglionesi , where considerable remains of an ancient town are said to exist

The Nordic states and the state of Novogorod soon began expanding northwards , dividing Sámi lands into spheres of interest . A system of joint taxation was established for parts of the Sámi area , so that , for example , the Sámi between the Lyngen Alps and the White Sea needed to pay taxes to both Norway / Denmark-Norway and Novgorod / Grand Duchy of Moscow / Tsardom of Russia . After the Time of Troubles and Kalmar War the borders became more concrete . In some areas , the Sámi still had to pay double taxes , though . The 18th century saw a further division of Sámi lands , between Denmark-Norway and Sweden . The final agreement led to the creation of the Lapp Codicil of 1751 which admitted some rights to the indigenous people . Following the Napoleonic Wars , Norway was transferred from Denmark to Sweden ; while Finland went from Sweden to Russia . This meant a transfer of most of the Sámi population from one sovereign to another . In 1826 the land border between Sweden-Norway and the Russian Empire in the northeast was finalized . While originally the " siida " s that were cut in two were to keep their rights on both sides of the border , this only lasted until Finland became sovereign and in 1920 got the Soviet Union 's border regions with Norway . Norway then made an agreement with Finland , causing the split " siida " s to lose their now ' Norwegian ' lands . Following World War II , Finland lost the territories between Norway and the Soviet Union , leaving the borders as they are presently .

Whilst the assessment process is rigorous , the UIA mark is not necessarily a 100 % guarantee that a member 's charges will remain totally transparent and unbiased . To do this would require a rigorous and ongoing assessment process in which members ' websites are continually monitored and customers contacted on a random basis to ensure their energy broker is complying with the UIA Code of Practice . In the absence of any complaint by the public , the degree in which members ' websites are actively monitoring for compliance to UIA Code of Practice is uncertain . Prior to engaging an energy broker it is important to request that the energy broker confirm they are independent , unbiased and exactly what their charges are . The UIA however does have a robust complaints process that enables the customer in the absence of an acceptable solution , to be referred to the independent customer redress scheme that forms part of the UIA Code of Practice and which the offending broker pays for .

Under Dhoni 's captaincy , India won the 2011 World Cup . In the final against Sri Lanka , chasing 275 , Dhoni promoted himself up the batting order , coming before an in-form Yuvraj Singh . When he came to bat , India needed more than six runs per over with three top order batsmen already dismissed . He started building a good partnership with Gautam Gambhir . Due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets , they kept up with the required run rate . Dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls but later accelerated with a greater frequency of boundaries , ending with 91 not out off 79 balls . Befitting the occasion , he finished the match off in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler Nuwan Kulasekara and won the Man of the Match award . Later in the post-match presentation , he admitted that he came up the order so as to counter the Muralitharan spin threat , as he was very familiar with Murali 's bowling , who was his teammate in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchise Chennai Super Kings .

She was then 31 years old and a few weeks before the Second World War had begun.The jury decided to award the first prize to Débora . The reward of one hundred pesos was given for the picture Sisters of Charity ( also known as Sisters of the Presentation ) . The choice of this work was made as a way to appease the possible scandal that would be rewarded if one of the two nudes to the watercolor that also presented the artist , named " Cantarina de la Rosa " and " La Amiga . " Despite the controversy over the nudes exhibited in the Union Club was immediate . On the one hand , the more traditional artists such as Eladio Vélez . On the other hand , the nudes were judged as scandalous by social sectors whose voices were taken by the local conservative press , as is the case of the newspaper La Defensa , which commented : ... " an impudent work that not even a man should exhibit .... " Little by little , the episode acquired political overtones and the liberal press assumed the defense of someone whom it saw as a brave woman . In the midst of the scandal , Débora Arango expressed a concept without antecedents in the national artistic milieu , today much cited about her painting : " art , as a manifestation of culture , has nothing to do with moral codes . Art is not amoral or immoral . Simply its orbit does not intercept any ethical postulate . "

Reportedly Nedham obtained an audience with King Charles I , and gained a royal pardon . Despite his history of writing parliamentary propaganda , he was commissioned to print a Royalist periodical , " Mercurius Pragmaticus , " starting in September 1647 and continuing for two years . It has been claimed as " one of the wittier and less ephemeral " of the " Cavalier weeklies . " " Pragmaticus " opened each issue with a satirical poem directed at various parliamentary figures and is notable for the quality of its sources . Nedham certainly didn 't tone down any of the scandalous nature of his personal attacks , referring to Cromwell at various points as " Copper- Nose , " " Nose Almighty , " and " The Town-bull of Ely . " Although he was responsible for the majority of issues , this particular newsbook was notable for the number of counterfeits that it inspired , with as many as 17 different versions available at various times . While some would have been created to trade off the name of the original to make money , there seems to be disagreement as to who owned the " true " " Pragmaticus . " It seems that some fellow royalists had never really accepted that Nedham had changed sides in good faith , calling him a " turne-coat and inveterate enemy to the late king .

One use of caching is to store ASP.NET session state data . When a user connects to an ASP.NET Web application , the application can store information in session state . This can be used in subsequent requests from the same user . Rather than store that information in-memory on each web server , a built-in session state provider can route session data to a backend cache . This enables the ASP.NET application to store large amounts of cached data . It also allows future user requests to route to any web server , because each web server references the same backend cache .

In the last period of his life , despite never having formally studied economic theory , he started teaching the subject and covering topics raised by the American poet Ezra Pound . He pioneered monetary law as an academic discipline in the University of Teramo - developing an economic theory that outlines how currency - as a measure of value and as such conventionally accepted by those who use it as a medium of exchange - is a " tool " for the exchange of goods ( the theory of the induced value of money ) . His theory is that those who accept the convention of a currency 's value , have the right to own it at its inception ( the people 's ownership of money ) . In this sense , the central banks are private corporations , who according to Auriti derive undue profits from seigniorage on the issue of paper money , assuming responsibility for an important source of public debt . This theory draws more power from the abolition of the direct relationship between money ( convertible into gold ) and gold reserve , established by the Bretton Woods initiative launched by the Richard Nixon administration on 15 August 1971 . It , thereafter , transformed the business of issuing currency and further emphasized the conventional nature of monetary value created by the acceptance by the people of this convention .

Bending is sometimes used to achieve a design . If a plant 's tissue is bent at too sharp an angle it may break , which can be mostly avoided by un-localizing the bend . This is achieved by making small bends along the curve of the tree . Bends are then held in place for several years until their form is permanently cast . The tree 's rate of growth determines the time necessary to overcome its resistance to the initial bending . The work of bending and securing in this way might be accomplished in an hour or perhaps in an afternoon depending on the design .

Asymmetric warfare featured prominently during the Second Boer War . After an initial phase , which was fought by both sides as a conventional war , the British captured Johannesburg , the Boers ' largest city , and captured the capitals of the two Boer Republics . The British then expected the Boers to accept peace as dictated by the victors in the traditional European way . However instead of capitulating , the Boers fought a protracted guerrilla war . 20,000-30,000 Boer guerrillas were only defeated after the British brought to bear 450,000 troops , about ten times as many as were used in the conventional phase of the war . During this phase the British introduced internment in concentration camps for the Boer civilian population and also implemented a scorched earth policy . Later , the British began using blockhouses built within machine gun range of one another and flanked by barbed wire to slow the Boers ' movement across the countryside and block paths to valuable targets . Such tactics eventually evolved into today 's counter insurgency tactics .

He could successfully cut this lump out , and described how to do so in a historical document which still remains . In technical terms , the Fistula in Ano , without any regard to the strict definition of the word , is understood to be an abscess , running upon , or into the Intestinum Rectum ; though an abscess in this part , when once ruptured , does generally , if neglected , grow callous in its cavity and edges , and become at last what is properly called a " fistula .

All other colors are produced by the action of additional alleles acting on these two base colors .

Recently it has been shown that upregulation of IFRD1 in vivo in injured muscle potentiates muscle regeneration by increasing the production of staminal muscle cells ( satellite cells ) . The underlying molecular mechanism lies in the ability of IFRD1 to cooperate with MyoD at inducing the transcriptional activity of MEF2C . This relies on the ability of IFRD1 to bind selectively MEF2C , thus inhibiting its interaction with HDAC4 . Therefore , IFRD1 appears to act as a positive cofactor of MyoD . More recently it has been shown that IFRD1 potentiates muscle regeneration by a second mechanism that potentiates MyoD , i.e. , by repressing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB , which is known to inhibit MyoD mRNA accumulation . IFRD1 represses the activity of NF-κB p65 by enhancing the HDAC-mediated deacetylation of the p65 subunit , by favoring the recruitment of HDAC3 to p65 . In fact IFRD1 forms trimolecular complexes with p65 and HDAC3 .

The engineering firm for the dam is the Finnish company Pöyry . Pöyry carried out a comparison between the original design of the dam and the recommendations of the Mekong River Commission , a body that brings together all riparian states of the lower Mekong and that has carried out a strategic environmental assessment for the impact of the planned cascade of dams on the Mekong . In that comparison , Pöyry recommended improving the sustainability of the dam " including additional environmental studies , installation of additional fish ladders and other measures to improve fish migration as well as technical design modifications to improve the sediment and nutrients handling . " After this , Pöyry was contracted to modify the design and to supervise the dam 's construction , without awaiting the results of the unspecified " additional environmental studies . " Critics point out that analyzing the environmental impact of a dam inherently constitutes a conflict of interest with the more lucrative design and supervision of the dam .

Reed Elsevier Inc . ( et al . ) , the petitioners of this case , publish electronic content for other companies , such as The New York Times . The respondents , Irvin Muchnick , ( et al . ) , are freelance writers and trade groups who represent other writers . In the 1980s , Elsevier gathered newspaper , magazine and journal articles and converted them to electronic format . It then sold access to these files without permission from the original writers . This resulted in the respondents initiating a class-action lawsuit against Elsevier for copyright infringement in the Southern District Court of New York . The Supreme Court of the United States had previously held , in " New York Times Co. v. Tasini , " that § 201 ( c ) of the United States Copyright Act bars publishers from reproducing freelance works electronically without authorization specifically for the purpose . " Tasini " brought about the removal of " hundreds of thousands " of print media republished by those without proper permission . Eventually , the parties in " Elsevier " agreed to settle . Their agreement required compensation ( up to $ 18 million ) to the original publishers of the works that were reprinted without authorization . In return , the authors would release the publishers from liability regarding the unauthorized articles . As the District Court prepared for the settlement , the plaintiffs , led by Muchnick , objected to the settlement , questioning its fairness , but not the District Court 's jurisdiction over the matter . The District Court overruled this objection and granted the settlement in September 2005 . The objectors appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals .

The blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) is one critical example of protection which prevents toxins and other adverse compounds from reaching the brain . As the brain requires nutrient entry and waste removal , it is perfused by blood flow . Blood can carry a number of ingested toxins , however , which would induce significant neuron death if they reach nervous tissue . Thus , protective cells termed astrocytes surround the capillaries in the brain and absorb nutrients from the blood and subsequently transport them to the neurons , effectively isolating the brain from a number of potential chemical insults .

Roca y Ponsa gained his name mostly thanks to views on religion and politics . They were underpinned by confidence that a community without an officially accepted and enforced orthodoxy , a community where various concepts of public life constantly compete for domination , can not form an orderly , peaceful , operational society . In his view the only appropriate orthodoxy was Catholicism , which for centuries shaped the Spanish self and contributed to greatness of the nation ; Catholic principles should serve as guidelines organizing both state and society . Their antithesis was liberalism , not only useless as a political doctrine , but also unacceptable as a moral concept ; it remained responsible for decline of Spain and led towards further calamities in the future . Roca 's view was fairly typical for some sections of the Spanish society , yet it was expressed in most absolute and intransigent form ; politics was viewed as battleground between God and Satan .

" She also was positive to the dynamic between the Doctor , Amy , and Rory , as it was different from other characters seen previously on the show , and continuing with the same character allowed the series to feel more " multi-layered . " Charlie Jane Anders of io9 described it as " of the most unusual , and structurally ambitious , eras in " Doctor Who " history " and praised the way the story revolved around the Doctor .

Both residual ice caps overlie thick layered deposits of interbedded ice and dust . In the north , the layered deposits form a 3 km-high , 1,000 km-diameter plateau called Planum Boreum . A similar kilometers-thick plateau , Planum Australe , lies in the south . Both plana ( the Latin plural of planum ) are sometimes treated as synonymous with the polar ice caps , but the permanent ice ( seen as the high albedo , white surfaces in images ) forms only a relatively thin mantle on top of the layered deposits . The layered deposits probably represent alternating cycles of dust and ice deposition caused by climate changes related to variations in the planet 's orbital parameters over time ( see also Milankovitch cycles ) . The polar layered deposits are some of the youngest geologic units on Mars .

Giyoo Hatano and Kayoko Inagaki , proposed three factors that impact the development of adaptive expertise . First , the degree to which an individual 's environment contains " randomness " requires one to modify skills based on careful observation of interacting factors . The second factor concerns the degree to which an individual is rewarded for performing skills . They theorized that environments with fewer rewards encourage individuals to experiment , rather than attempting to master rules by which they might gain rewards . The third factor is the degree to which the individual 's cultural context values and promotes understanding of skills over efficiency . These factors , the authors believe , serve to promote not just procedural understanding but conceptual understanding of skills .

Research on priming and practice use single word tests to assess for the presence of TOT states . The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word . Evidence that comes from the usefulness of priming and practice in reducing TOT states is that most information in TOT states is low-frequency ; that is , it has not been used or recalled for some time . The recency of information use can influence the retrieval process of that information . The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate TOT state resolution . Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall , they are more likely to overcome their TOT state . When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter , an interesting effect occurs : When the prime word has similar phonology to the target word , an increase in the frequency of TOT states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the TOT state is resolved is observed . Incorrect words come to mind involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word . Thus , phonological similarity can both decrease and increase TOT states . However , it is possible to fix this problem by changing the syntactic class of the priming word . Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in TOT state resolution . The TOT state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words . If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words , then the position is of importance . The earlier in the list the priming word is , the less likely it is to help resolve the TOT state .
Dallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs , and their first playoff trip was modestly successful as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in five games . The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at Moody Coliseum , as Reunion Arena , then the home court for the Mavericks , was hosting a tennis tournament . The Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers were next for the Mavs , and the young club fell short , losing four games to one . But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984 , because they owned Cleveland 's first-round pick , which ended up being the fourth pick overall . The Mavs used it to select forward / center Sam Perkins , a former North Carolina Tar Heel with surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas .

Conservative Protestants ( Evangelicals , Charismatics , Pentecostals , and other denominations ) have often argued that suicide is self-murder , and so anyone who commits it is sinning and it is the same as if the person murdered another human being . An additional view concerns the act of asking for salvation and accepting Jesus Christ as personal savior , which must be done prior to death . This is an important aspect of many Protestant denominations , and the problem with suicide is that once dead the individual is unable to accept salvation . The unpardonable sin then becomes not the suicide itself , but rather the refusal of the gift of salvation .

In biochemistry , the native state of a protein or nucleic acid is its properly folded and / or assembled form , which is operative and functional . The native state of a biomolecule may possess all four levels of biomolecular structure , with the secondary through quaternary structure being formed from weak interactions along the covalently-bonded backbone . This is in contrast to the denatured state , in which these weak interactions are disrupted , leading to the loss of these forms of structure and retaining only the biomolecule 's primary structure .

Cloem can optionally publish one or more created texts , as electronic publications or as paper-printed publications . These can potentially serve -through a defensive publication- as prior art to prevent another party for obtaining a patent on the subject-matter at stake . In other words , after an initial patent filing , an " improvement " patent ( adjacent invention ) can be applied for by another party , such as a competitor . By publishing variants of a patent claim , the risk of adverse patenting may potentially be decreased ( improvement inventions may no longer be patentable ) .

By February 1946 , the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation . In 1947 , Rocker published " Zur Betrachtung der Lage in Deutschland " ( " Regarding the Portrayal of the Situation in Germany " ) about the impossibility of another anarchist movement in Germany . It became the first post-World War II anarchist writing to be distributed in Germany . Rocker thought young Germans were all either totally cynical or inclined to fascism and awaited a new generation to grow up before anarchism could bloom once again in the country . Nevertheless , the Federation of Libertarian Socialists ( FFS ) was founded in 1947 by former FAUD members . Rocker wrote for its organ , " Die Freie Gesellschaft , " which survived until 1953 . In 1949 , Rocker published another well-known work . In " Pioneers of American Freedom , " a series of essays , he details the history of liberal and anarchist thought in the United States , seeking to debunk the idea that radical thought was foreign to American history and culture and had merely been imported by immigrants .

Most scholars have attempted to meld these stories . It has been alleged that Theodemir must have been a successor of Ariamir 's , since Ariamir was the first Suevic monarch to lift the ban on Catholic synods ; Isidore therefore gets the chronology wrong . Reinhart suggested that Chararic was converted first through the relics of Saint Martin and that Theodemir was converted later through the preaching of Martin of Dumio . Felix Dahn equated Chararic with Theodemir , even saying that the latter was the name he took upon baptism . It has also been suggested that Theodemir and Ariamir were the same person and the son of Chararic . Ferreiro believes the conversion of the Suevi was progressive and stepwise and that Thoedemir was responsible for beginning a persecution of the Arians in his kingdom to root out their heresy .

Energy consumption increases by orders of magnitude as we go higher in the memory hierarchy . United States president Barack Obama cited Communication-Avoiding Algorithms in the FY 2012 Department of Energy budget request to Congress : " " New Algorithm Improves Performance and Accuracy on Extreme-Scale Computing Systems . On modern computer architectures , communication between processors takes longer than the performance of a floating point arithmetic operation by a given processor . ASCR researchers have developed a new method , derived from commonly used linear algebra methods , to minimize communications between processors and the memory hierarchy , by reformulating the communication patterns specified within the algorithm . This method has been implemented in the TRILINOS framework , a highly-regarded suite of software , which provides functionality for researchers around the world to solve large scale , complex multi-physics problems .

In the city 's early years , following its incorporation in 1896 , there were several de facto streetcar or trolley systems , many of which were short-lived . The first known electric streetcar was an interurban that operated circa 1906 , operated by the Miami Electric Railway Company . Another streetcar began operation in 1909 and was short-lived ; another battery-powered streetcar was introduced in 1915 by the Miami Traction Company . It wasn 't until 1922 that the more widely known electric streetcar system was implemented , using an extensive overhead catenary . It operated a high-speed line from Miami to Ponce de Leon Boulevard in Coral Gables via Coral Way beginning in 1925 .

The Senate has concluded that members of Congress ( Representatives and Senators ) are not " civil officers " for purposes of impeachment . As a practical matter , expulsion is effected by the simpler procedures of Article I , Section 5 , which provides " Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections , Returns and Qualifications of its own Members ... Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings , punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour , and , with the Concurrence of two thirds , expel a Member . " ( " see List of United States senators expelled or censured and List of United States Representatives expelled , censured , or reprimanded " ) .

cAMP is a signaling molecule important for a variety of cellular functions. cAMP exerts its effects by activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) , which transduces the signal through phosphorylation of different target proteins . The inactive holoenzyme of PKA is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. cAMP causes the dissociation of the inactive holoenzyme into a dimer of regulatory subunits bound to four cAMP and two free monomeric catalytic subunits . Four different regulatory subunits and three catalytic subunits of PKA have been identified in humans . The protein encoded by this gene is one of the regulatory subunits . This subunit can be phosphorylated by the activated catalytic subunit . This subunit has been shown to interact with and suppress the transcriptional activity of the cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 ( CREB1 ) in activated T cells . Knockout studies in mice suggest that this subunit may play an important role in regulating energy balance and adiposity . The studies also suggest that this subunit may mediate the gene induction and cataleptic behavior induced by haloperidol .

By 2001 around 5,000 copies had been sold in North Dakota itself . The Video Game History Foundation described the program as " a hit in North Dakotan classrooms , but a flop for Broderbund . "

Like many of Card 's works , the novel is an expansion of a short story , his " Lost Boys , " which can be found in his short story compilation " Maps in a Mirror . " In the short story version , Card assumes Fletcher 's role as the protagonist .

John Bowlby begins by noting organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways , ranging from primitive reflex-like " fixed action patterns " to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components . In the most complex organisms , instinctive behaviors may be " goal-corrected " with continual on-course adjustments ( such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey ) .

Racial categories in Latin America are often linked to both continental ancestry or mixture as inferred from phenotypical traits , but also to socio-economic status . Ethnicity is often constructed either as an amalgam national identity or as something reserved for the indigenous groups so that ethnic identity is something that members of indigenous groups have in addition to their national identity . Racial and ethnic discrimination is common in Latin America where socio-economic status generally correlates with perceived whiteness , and indigenous status and perceived African ancestry is generally correlated with poverty and lack of opportunity and social status .
Historians have defined the term Deccan differently . These definitions range from a narrow one by R. G. Bhandarkar ( 1920 ) , who defines Deccan as the Marathi-speaking area lying between the Godavari and the Krishna rivers , to a broad one by K. M. Panikkar ( 1969 ) , who defines it as the entire Indian peninsula to the south of the Vindhyas . Firishta ( 16th century ) defined Deccan as the territory inhabited by the native speakers of Kannada , Marathi , and Telugu languages . Richard M. Eaton ( 2005 ) settles on this linguistic definition for a discussion of the region 's geopolitical history . Stewart N. Gordon ( 1998 ) notes that historically , the term " Deccan " had the overtones of an area considered suitable for conquest by northern kingdoms : the northern border of Deccan has thus varied from Tapti River in north to Godavari River in south , depending on the southern boundary of the northern empires . Therefore , while discussing the history of the Marathas , Gordon uses Deccan as a " relational term , " defining it as " the area beyond the southern border of a northern-based kingdom " of India .

The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania . Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum , or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education . The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent , but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher , depending on a number of factors , such as property values and the personal income of district residents . Act 1 included 10 exceptions , including : increasing pension costs , increases in special education costs , a catastrophe like a fire or flood , increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases . The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage , as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry , for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools , as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor , for the previous 12-month period ending June 30 . For a school district with a market value / personal income aid ratio ( MV / PI AR ) greater than 0.4000 , its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV / PI AR for the current year . In June 2011 , the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index . Several exceptions were maintained : 1 ) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4 , 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27 , 2006 for non-Act 72 schools ; 2 ) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt ; 3 ) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services ( beyond what is already paid by the State ) ; and 4 ) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school 's share of payments to PSERS ( PA school employees pension fund ) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate .

The main form of food production in such societies is the daily collection of wild plants and the hunting of wild animals . Hunter-gatherers move around constantly in search of food . As a result , they do not build permanent villages or create a wide variety of artifacts , and usually only form small groups such as bands and tribes . However , some hunting and gathering societies in areas with abundant resources ( such as people of tlingit ) lived in larger groups and formed complex hierarchical social structures such as chiefdom . The need for mobility also limits the size of these societies . They generally consist of fewer than 60 people and rarely exceed 100 . Statuses within the tribe are relatively equal , and decisions are reached through general agreement . The ties that bind the tribe are more complex than those of the bands . Leadership is personal - charismatic - and used for special purposes only in tribal society . There are no political offices containing real power , and a chief is merely a person of influence , a sort of adviser ; therefore , tribal consolidations for collective action are not governmental . The family forms the main social unit , with most members being related by birth or marriage . This type of organization requires the family to carry out most social functions , including production and education .

He commented on the cover art , recalling the cover of " Day of Al 'Akbar , " saying " here we at last have a sexy elf and a hunky bloke to go with the bosom brigade . Can 't really complain about this cover too much really , the molten lava they walk around in almost-naked does after all give a hint as to the magnitude of adventure to expect . This is , after all , the first of the Immortal scenario packs , and we 're all expecting something rather epic . We are not to be disappointed . " He commented on the scope of the adventure : " A solution of riddles , the Immortals game takes " D & D " to its ultimate conclusion , magic and technology become truly intermingled in the mechanics of " D & D " sorcery . The strange thing is , that when [ player characters ] can transfer across the planes , pluck starfire from flaming suns and use wishes like ship computers , it all becomes absolutely excellent fun . The setting is so cosmic , it 's a totally different game , and a very appealing one . " He called the Immortals ' visit to the " dour " plane of technology " one of the best bits of the adventure " and noted that " New York City is a dangerous place for stranded Immortals . " Zunder concluded the review by saying : " Frank Mentzer has come up with a really good one here , a scenario so far beyond " Basic D & D " as to really be a totally different game and setting altogether . I wasn 't expecting to enjoy this , but I found the ideas really good fun and was tempted to go and play the game really and properly ... I guess that 's a yes for the " Immortal D & D " owners , and a suggestion to the lower levels that they might skip the intermediate stuff altogether and have an ogle at this little lot . "

Hegemony analysis : The supremacy of the greater states - like that of the bigger enterprises - leads to overproportional assertiveness and thus to privileges for these actors obtained by persuasion or by force . On the other hand , integration brings about dependencies binding all participants . So there is a structure of symmetric and asymmetric connections , which can be found both inside and outside of the respective state cartels . The analysis of these complex forms of international relations is in the focus of state cartel theory and can lead to a global analysis of state cartels and state cartel effects . A not considered aspect is the " disrupter , " often manifesting itself in opposition to real or perceived grievance brought to bear , at little relative cost , to its effect such as the attacks on the World Trade Center where two aircraft as weapons brought to sharp focus world attention the power of a new terror .

Chimps and humans share only 50 % of their parasite and microbe species . This is due to the differences in environmental and dietary adaptations ; human internal parasite species overlap more with omnivorous , savanna-dwelling baboons . The chimpanzee is host to the louse species " Pediculus schaeffi , " a close relative of " P. humanus " which infests human head and body hair . By contrast , the human pubic louse " Pthirus pubis " is closely related to " Pthirus gorillae " which infests gorillas . A 2017 study of gastrointestinal parasites of wild chimps in degraded forests in Uganda found nine species of protozoa , five nematodes , one cestode , and one trematode . The most prevalent species was the protozoan " Troglodytella abrassarti . "

Research has shown that polyaniline nanofibers can also be used to create nonvolatile plastic digital memory devices when decorated with various metal , such as gold , nanoparticles . Gold nanoparticles are grown inside dedoped polyaniline nanofibers using a redox reaction . A plastic composite film is placed between two electrodes , and an external bias is used to program ON-OFF states . The switching mechanism is thought to be caused through an interaction between the polyaniline nanofibers and the gold nanoparticles , where charge is transferred to the gold nanoparticles from the polyaniline nanofibers due to an induced electric field . Switching between the ON-OFF states has shown to be rapid , with times of less than 25ns . The retention time of these simple devices are on the order of days after programming , and write-read-erase cycles have been demonstrated .

Pohl oversaw the organization of the concentration camps , deciding on the distribution of detainees to the various camps and the " rental " of detainees for slave labour until 1944 . The exploitation of the captives rested on the Nazi principle of " extermination through labor . " Human material was to be efficiently and fully exploited in the process and as former Buchenwald political prisoner and historian Eugen Kogon points out , Pohl insisted on extracting the maximum financial worth from each and every camp laborer . Kogon asserts that Pohl even created evaluative tables that calculated their value as farmed-out wage earners ( minus the depreciation of food and clothing ) , their profit intake from valuables ( watches , clothing , money ) remaining after their deaths ( minus crematoria expenses ) , and any costs recovered from selling their bones and ashes ; in total , the average concentration camp inmate had a life expectancy of nine months or less and was valued at 1,630 marks . Along these lines , Pohl supervised the macabre task of collecting Jewish people 's gold fillings , hair , clothing , jewelry and other possessions . These " spoils , " taken from the concentration camp inmates ( mostly Jews ) were carefully itemized and sold at prices set by the WVHA .

Nearly all stories are pre-recorded , even segments made to look like they are occurring live ; instead of a " live " indicator during field reports from NY1 's reporters , most stories seen on the channel have an on-screen graphic merely stating that the reporter is / was " on scene . " This is because when the report was first broadcast , it may have originally been shown live but is not once it is re-aired , unless it updates a breaking news event . Moreover , reporters generally tape their own stories with video cameras ( a practice known as video journalism ) , and send these taped reports to the newsroom to be edited for broadcast . A practice unique only to NY1 when it debuted , the ' one-man band ' mode of journalism where the reporter records their own stories and surrounding narration has now become a standard with most local newscasts throughout the United States .

The southern stingray is adapted for life on the sea bed . The flattened , diamond-shaped body has sharp corners , making it more angular than the discs of other rays . The top of the body varies between olive brown and green in adults , dark grey in juveniles , whilst the underside is predominantly white . The wing-like pectoral fins are used to propel the stingray across the ocean bottom , whilst the slender tail possesses a long , serrated and venomous spine at the base , used for defence . These spines are not fatal to humans , but are incredibly painful if stepped on . The eyes are situated on top of the head of the southern stingray , along with small openings called spiracles . The location of the spiracles enables the stingray to take in water whilst lying on the seabed , or when partially buried in sediment . Water enters the spiracles and leaves through the gill openings , bypassing the mouth which is on the underside . Female stingrays can grow to a disc width of 150 cm , contrary to the smaller male stingrays that reach maximum size at 67 cm .

A syntactic expletive is a term used in formal linguistic theories . It is a term for a pronoun that is used at the start of a sentence or clause when the referent is not immediately known , but an argument for the verb is syntactically required . The basic meaning of the clause is made explicit after the verb . Common forms of construction for sentences that contain a syntactic expletive begin with " it is , " " here is , " or " there is . " The expletive serves as the grammatical subject of the independent clause that it begins . In a clause like " it is raining " the referent of the pronoun " it " is not obvious , and is the subject of discussion and alternate theories among linguists . Syntactic expletives have great significance in the study of the history of languages and cross-cultural comparisons . The term is distinct from the expletives of traditional grammar in that a syntactic expletive has a particular syntactical meaning .

Emily Martin examines the metaphors used in science to support her claim that science reinforces socially constructed ideas about gender rather than objective views of nature . In her study about the fertilization process , Martin describes several cases when gender-biased perception skewed the descriptions of biological processes during fertilization and even possibly hampered the research . She asserts that classic metaphors of the strong dominant sperm racing to an idle egg are products of gendered stereotyping rather than a faithful portrayal of human fertilization . The notion that women are passive and men are active are socially constructed attributes of gender which , according to Martin , scientists have projected onto the events of fertilization and so obscuring the fact that eggs do play an active role . For example , she wrote that " even after having revealed ... the egg to be a chemically active sperm catcher , even after discussing the egg 's role in tethering the sperm , the research team continued for another three years to describe the sperm 's role as actively penetrating the egg . " Scott Gilbert , a developmental biologist at Swarthmore College supports her position : " if you don 't have an interpretation of fertilization that allows you to look at the egg as active , you won 't look for the molecules that can prove it . You simply won 't find activities that you don 't visualize . "

Even though the writers behind Ayn Rand Institute and Ayn Rand Lexicon define themselves as Objectivists and are more often opposed to libertarians , large minorities of right-libertarians , mainly in the United states , use aspects of Ayn Rand 's Objectivism to justify their foreign policy beliefs on the right of defense . A very common view on dictatorship among these is the view that a dictatorial society is an outlaw that can claim no rights and that any free society has a right to forcibly change any dictatorial society into another free one , but should absolutely not assume this to be any kind of self-sacrificial duty . When it comes to broader American foreign policy , these libertarians believe that the crux of American foreign policy should be free trade , including abolition of protectionism as a corporatist element . Many libertarians will argue from perspectives most associated with Ayn Rand Institute to justify siding with Israel over the Arab League , regarding the war that the Arab League launched against Israel in 1948 . Some libertarians will use Objectivist arguments to criticize the tendency of many of their own to focus on trivial crimes by free societies instead of severe crimes by tyrannical societies .

Some manuscripts have four " padas " ( parts ) with 112 chapters , and some two " khandas " with 111 chapters .

Fossils indicate that the lineage leading to modern " Agathis " and " Wollemia " evolved from the common ancestor with " Araucaria " in the Early Cretaceous in southern Gondwana within climates experiencing cool moist conditions and a strong photoperiod regime . The most recent common ancestor of " Agathis " and " Wollemia " has been proposed to be at least 110 million years old ( Early Cretaceous ) deduced from the reported oldest fossils of these genera . However , genetic evidence suggests that the divergence of " Agathis " and " Wollemia " occurred 61 ± 15 Ma around the beginning of the Cenozoic rather than in the Early Cretaceous . In another recent molecular study , an age of only 18 Ma was inferred for the divergence of " Agathis " and " Wollemia . " This also accords with recent revisions of the fossil record in New Zealand that reveal no examples of " Agathis " or " Wollemia " -like remains older than the Cenozoic . The relatively minor genetic and morphological diversity in extant species of " Agathis " compared to the variation in " Araucaria " is further evidence of the earlier divergence of " Araucaria . "

In a traditional patriarchal society , the social norms place serious restrictions on women 's ability to make a living outside of marriage .

This typically leads to higher fertility and an unspoken pact of responsibility between parents and their children .

The chiefs were in favour of a balanced rearmament but within financial limits , the air force should be favoured . In 1937 , the Minister argued that a continental commitment was no longer feasible and that France did not now expect a big land army along with the navy and air force , Germany had guaranteed Belgian neutrality and that if the quantity of money was limited , defence against air attack , trade protection and the defence of overseas territories were more important and had to be secured before Britain could support allies in the defence of their territories . The " continental hypothesis " came fourth and the main role of the army was to protect the empire , which included the anti-aircraft defence of the United Kingdom ( with the assistance of the TA ) .

CTLA4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is expressed by activated T cells and transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells . CTLA4 is homologous to the T-cell co-stimulatory protein , CD28 , and both molecules bind to CD80 and CD86 , also called B7-1 and B7-2 respectively , on antigen-presenting cells . CTLA-4 binds CD80 and CD86 with greater affinity and avidity than CD28 thus enabling it to outcompete CD28 for its ligands . CTLA4 transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells , whereas CD28 transmits a stimulatory signal . CTLA4 is also found in regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) and contributes to their inhibitory function . T cell activation through the T cell receptor and CD28 leads to increased expression of CTLA-4 .

Nugent JA disagreed with the court a quo , which he said had erred in holding Chartaprops liable vicariously for the negligence of Advanced Planning . Liability , according to Nugent , could be found elsewhere , but it could not be on the basis of vicarious liability : " Where liability arises vicariously , it is because the defendant and the wrongdoer stand in a particular relationship to one another . " According to Nugent , the rules which applied in this case did not involve the role of independent contractor ; the employer is not and ought not to be held responsible for the actions of an independent contractor . The defendant might be responsible for its " own " omission , its own failure to act , or to perform its own legal duties , taking reasonable steps as articulated in Kruger v Coetzee . Nugent applied the principle of non-delegability , based on English law : There was a duty on Chartaprops , as owner of the mall , to ensure that its visitors were reasonably safe . It could not shift this responsibility to the cleaning company . According to Nugent , therefore , liability rested on Chartaprops as the owner of the premises : " A person who invites the public to frequent a shopping mall will be expected by members of the public to have ensured that the floors of the premises are reasonably safe and they will expect to look to that person if they are not . " Chartaprops had failed , in Nugent 's view , in its duty to the public to ensure that its premises were safe . Nugent exonerated Advanced Planning on the grounds that it owed no such duty to the public ; any omission on its part was therefore not actionable . This judgment , although progressive , is clearly wrong , according to Richman Mqeke , since it is based on non-delegability .

Tony Sclafani of PopMatters rated the album an eight out of ten , commenting " " Heroes & Thieves " isn 't a perfect album and sometimes gets too idiosyncratic and precious for its own good . It 's already spawned its share of detractors , specifically reviewers who question whether Carlton has the vocal goods to pull off some of the more complicated numbers .

Elections for the ad-hoc Divan were held in Wallachia in September 1857 . They restored a liberalizing trend that had been repressed following the 1848 revolution , also giving expression to the national awakening that was taking part among the Romanians . The toppling of the conservative " Regulamentul Organic " regime in both Danubian Principalities made them possible : following the 1856 Treaty of Paris , Wallachia and Moldavia functioned as a protectorates of the European powers ; both were also clients of the Ottoman Empire . Excluding the spontaneous rallies of 1848 , this was the first public consultation to be held in eleven years .

In 2018 , the International Panel of Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change , published a special report " " Global Warming of 1.5 ° C " " . " " It outlined the impacts of a 1.5 ° C global temperature rise above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways , and highlighted the possibility of avoiding a number of such impacts by limiting global warming to 1.5 ° C compared to 2 ° C , or more . The report mentioned that this would require global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO ) to fall by about 45 % from 2010 levels by 2030 , reaching " net zero " around 2050 , through " rapid and far-reaching " transitions in land , energy , industry , buildings , transport , and cities .

Psychoanalysts such as Bruno Bettelheim , who regarded the cruelty of older fairy tales as indicative of psychological conflicts , strongly criticized this expurgation , because it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues . Fairy tales do teach children how to deal with difficult times . To quote Rebecca Walters ( 2017 , p . 56 ) " Fairytales and folktales are part of the cultural conserve that can be used to address children 's fears .... and give them some role training in an approach that honors the children 's window of tolerance . " These fairy tales teach children how to deal with certain social situations and helps them to find their place in society . Fairy tales teach children other important lessons too . For example , Tsitsani et al. carried out a study on children to determine the benefits of fairy tales . Parents of the children who took part in the study found that fairy tales , especially the color in them , triggered their child 's imagination as the read them.Jungian Analyst and fairy tale scholar , Marie Louise Von Franz interprets fairy tales based on Jung 's view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul , which can only express what soul is . That means , she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul . They are the " purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes " and " they represent the archetypes in their simplest , barest and most concise form " because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends . " In this pure form , the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche . " " The fairy tale itself is its own best explanation ; that is , its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story . [ ... ] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these . " " I have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavour to describe one and the same psychic fact , but a fact so complex and far-reaching and so difficult for us to realize in all its different aspects that hundreds of tales and thousands of repetitions with a musician 's variation are needed until this unknown fact is delivered into consciousness ; and even then the theme is not exhausted . This unknown fact is what Jung calls the Self , which is the psychic reality of the collective unconscious . [ ... ] Every archetype is in its essence only one aspect of the collective unconscious as well as always representing also the whole collective unconscious .

For concessional loans the bank advances a no interest or very low interest rate loan to a developing country government or agency to build a project ( e.g. power plant , road , water treatment facility ) . The term of the concession loan is up to 20 years and a maximum grace period of 7 years is given . The preferential export buyer 's credit is provided to a foreign borrower to purchase Chinese goods or services ( e.g. construction contractor building the project ) . Like the concessional loan , this type of loan is also subsidized by the Chinese government . Interest rates are below market rates at around 3 to 6 % . However , the preferential export buyer 's credit is generally classified as a commercial loan rather than foreign aid even if the interest rate is very low because the purpose is to promote Chinese exports . These two types of loans are a major part of the financing support for China 's Belt and Road Initiative .

During World War II , production of new U. S. 3 ¢ commemorative stamps all but ceased . Among the three issues that appeared in 1942 was the celebrated Win the War stamp , which enjoyed enormously wide use , owing partly to patriotism and partly to the relative unavailability of alternatives . It presents an art deco eagle posed in a " V " shape for victory surrounded by 13 stars . The eagle is grasping arrows , but has no olive branch . A notable commemorative set did , indeed , appear in 1943-44 , but its stamps , all valued at 5 cents , were not competitive with the Win the War issue . This was the Overrun Countries series ( known to collectors as the Flag set ) , produced as a tribute to the thirteen nations that had been occupied by the Axis Powers .

Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin , e.g. , antibody , to an epitope on a pathogen . After opsonin binds to the membrane , phagocytes are attracted to the pathogen . The Fab portion of the antibody binds to the antigen , whereas the Fc portion of the antibody binds to an Fc receptor on the phagocyte , facilitating phagocytosis . The core receptor + opsonin complex also creates byproducts like C3b and C4b which are important components for the efficient function of the complement system . These components are deposited on the cell surface of the pathogen and aid in its destruction .

In parallel with the distancing role plays in coping with distress , it supports the broaden and build theory that positive emotions lead to increased multilateral cognitive pathway and social resource building .

He featured in 17 games for the " Lambs " in the 2004-05 season , without scoring a goal . He was loaned out to League One club Stockport County in November 2004 , who were managed by his former Northern Ireland boss Sammy McIlroy ; Preston manager Billy Davies said he hoped the move would boost Smith 's confidence levels . However , he returned to Preston after playing just twice at Edgeley Park .

One critique of the Build-up Phase data and predictions is that there needs to be better error descriptions . The global estimate of rainfall indicates that the confidence range is large relative to possible trends . The number of ground sensing stations ( currently around 40 ) in the BSRN is rather limited for global observation this affected the measurement of aerosols which are regionally dominant . The best measurements of aerosol pollution are obtained when cloud types are identified properly by satellite observation , therefore better cloud sensing strategies and models are needed to provide the clearest real-time data . Certain projects like GCIP allow have focused on continental scale observations provide better prediction for project areas ; however , areas outside these project areas may lag in receiving forecasting improvements . Many of the deficiencies in Phase I are improvement areas within the objectives of Phase II of the project . Currently scientist use NASA Aqua 's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer ( AMSR-E ) to evaluation soil moisture from space . However , except for focused observations the satellites data is not useful for global weather prediction . The proposed Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite would provide the detail of soil moisture information on a daily basis may provide the data needed for real time forecasting .

He increasingly identified with Whig politics , like his father and uncle , but whereas they had been moderate in their views , he grew increasingly more partisan and militant in his views . Britain was very divided between Whigs who favoured the succession of George of Hanover after Queen Anne 's death and Tories who supported the return of the Jacobite James Stuart , known later as the ' old pretender ' . This issue dominated British politics during the last few years of Queen Anne 's reign , leading up to her death in 1714 , and had a profound impact on the future career of the young Duke of Newcastle .

Although critically acclaimed , " Mechanical Animals " was initially not too well received by longtime fans who complained about the wilfully radio-friendly sound of the album and surmised that Marilyn Manson had " sold out . " It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 25 , 1999 , but was the lowest-selling number-one album of 1998 in the United States . Producer Beinhorn said : " When " Mechanical Animals " came out , the projected sales figure for the first week was 300,000 copies . [ The label was ] excited , saying , ' We 're going to hit No.1 and sell 300k ! ' . It sold 230,000 and got to No.1 , but it wasn 't enough . The label lost interest , they took down the huge billboard they had in Times Square for the album , the president of the label called Manson up , screaming at him for having tits on the cover . I think that , and what happened at Columbine , which really affected him emotionally , meant that he never made an album up to the standard of " Mechanical Animals " or " Antichrist Superstar " again . He just didn 't get the support . " As of November 2010 , " Mechanical Animals " sold 1,409,000 copies in the US .

Louros ( ) is a town and a former municipality in the Preveza regional unit , Epirus , Greece . Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Preveza , of which it is a municipal unit . The seat of the municipality was the small town of Louros ( pop . 1,938 in 2011 ) . The area of the municipal unit is 176.075 km ² , with a population of 4,581 people ( 2011 ) . The town and municipal unit are named after the river Louros which flows just south of the town . Until recently , the Louros valley was swampy , but in modern times the marshes were drained and are now used for the production of olives , oranges and tomatoes .

The primary role of the landing strip changed to that of a safety area surrounding the runway . This area had to be capable , under normal ( dry ) conditions , of supporting aircraft without causing structural damage to the airframe or injury to the occupants . Later , the designation of the area was changed to " runway safety area , " to reflect its functional role . The runway safety area enhances the safety of aircraft that undershoot , overrun , or veer off the runway , and it provides greater accessibility for firefighting and rescue equipment during such incidents . One of the difficulties is that overshooting aircraft do not always run off the end of the runway at relatively slow speed ; they leave from the side of the runway ( as in the TAM Brazilian Airlines Flight 3054 accident ) , they run off the end at such a high speed that they would overrun any safety area ( as in the Air France Flight 358 accident in Toronto ) , or they land well short of the runway ( as in the British Airways Flight 38 accident at Heathrow ) .

Reviewing the world premiere , Mark Swed of the " Los Angeles Times " remarked of the work , " The solo cello writing has a slightly autumnal flavor - maybe too autumnal for a vital 55-year-old composer ( he was born three days before Salonen ) . But this is also brilliantly mature cello writing that takes full advantage of Kartunnen 's natural grace unruffled by even the most extreme virtuosic demands . " He added , " Mainly , Lindberg exploits the cellist 's mastery of nuance . The orchestra is of modest size ( no percussion ) . Unlike in his first concerto , where cellist and orchestra are in fierce contrast , Lindberg removes conflict by painting with glowing instrumental colors an exotic sonic landscape around which the cello dives and dances and exults .
